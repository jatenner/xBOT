# üîß System Fixes - Posting Issues Resolved

## Critical Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Playwright Browser Crash (PRIMARY ISSUE)
**Problem:**  
System was using Playwright 1.47.2 which defaults to deprecated `--headless=old` mode, causing fatal zygote process crashes in Railway containers:
```
[FATAL:zygote_host_impl_linux.cc(190)] Check failed: process.IsValid(). Failed to launch zygote process
```

**Solution:**
- ‚úÖ Upgraded Playwright from `1.47.2` to `^1.48.2` 
- ‚úÖ Added `--headless=new` flag to all browser launch configurations
- ‚úÖ Updated 5 browser factory files:
  - `src/browser/UnifiedBrowserPool.ts`
  - `src/browser/browserFactory.ts`
  - `src/posting/headlessXPoster.ts`
  - `src/playwright/browserFactory.ts`
  - `src/infra/playwright/launcher.ts`

### 2. ‚úÖ Posting Queue Stuck
**Problem:**  
Queue kept finding decisions to post but browser crashed before posting could happen, causing silent failures.

**Solution:**
- Browser crash fix (above) resolves the root cause
- System will now successfully launch browser and post content

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Stuck Queued Decisions in Database
**Problem:**  
10 decisions stuck in `queued` status from failed posting attempts.

**Solution:**  
SQL script created at `scripts/clear-stuck-queue.sql` - run this on Railway to clear stuck decisions.

## üìã Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Updated Code to Railway

```bash
# Commit the fixes
git add package.json src/browser/ src/posting/ src/playwright/ src/infra/

git commit -m "Fix Playwright browser crash - upgrade to 1.48.2 with new headless mode"

git push origin main
```

Railway will auto-deploy with the new Playwright version.

### Step 2: Clear Stuck Queue (Run on Railway)

Option A - Using Railway CLI:
```bash
# Install Railway CLI if needed
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and link project
railway login
railway link

# Run SQL to clear stuck decisions
railway run psql $DATABASE_URL < scripts/clear-stuck-queue.sql
```

Option B - Using Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to your Supabase project SQL Editor
2. Run this query:
```sql
-- Mark stuck decisions as failed
UPDATE content_metadata
SET status = 'failed'
WHERE status = 'queued'
  AND scheduled_at < (NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour')
  AND decision_id NOT IN (
    SELECT decision_id FROM posted_decisions
  );
```

### Step 3: Monitor Posting

After deployment, watch the logs:
```bash
npm run logs
```

You should see:
- ‚úÖ No more zygote crash errors
- ‚úÖ "BROWSER_POOL: ‚úÖ Browser initialized" messages
- ‚úÖ "POSTING_QUEUE: ‚úÖ Content posted" messages
- ‚úÖ Actual tweets being posted to X/Twitter

## üîç Verification Checklist

After deploying, verify:

- [ ] No zygote crash errors in logs
- [ ] Browser initializes successfully  
- [ ] Content posts to Twitter
- [ ] Decisions move from `queued` to `posted` in database
- [ ] Tweet IDs are captured in `posted_decisions` table
- [ ] System posts 2 tweets per hour (MAX_POSTS_PER_HOUR setting)

---

## üö® If Issues Persist

1. **Check Playwright installation on Railway:**
   ```bash
   railway run npx playwright install chromium --with-deps
   ```

2. **Verify environment variables:**
   - `TWITTER_SESSION_B64` exists and is valid
   - `posting_disabled=false` in logs

3. **Check Twitter session:**
   - Session may have expired - need to re-authenticate
   - Run session refresh if needed

---

## üìä Files Changed

**package.json:**
- Playwright: `1.47.2` ‚Üí `^1.48.2`

**Browser Configurations (5 files):**
- Added `--headless=new` flag to prevent zygote crashes

**New Files:**
- `scripts/clear-stuck-queue.sql` - SQL to clear stuck queue
- `FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This file

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline

- **Problem Duration:** 9+ hours without posting
- **Root Cause:** Playwright version incompatibility with Railway containers
- **Fix Time:** Immediate (upgrade + flag addition)
- **Expected Recovery:** Within 5 minutes of deployment

---

## üí° Prevention

To prevent this in the future:
1. Keep Playwright updated (check for deprecation warnings)
2. Always use `--headless=new` in container environments
3. Monitor browser initialization logs for errors
4. Set up alerts for posting failures > 1 hour

**Status:** ‚úÖ All fixes applied and ready for deployment
**Next Action:** Push to GitHub and let Railway auto-deploy
