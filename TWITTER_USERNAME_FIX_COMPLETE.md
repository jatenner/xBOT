# ✅ TWITTER USERNAME FIX - DEPLOYED

## 🐛 **THE BUG:**

The system had a username mismatch:
- **Actual Twitter Account:** `@Signal_Synapse` (with underscore `_`)
- **Railway Environment Variable:** `TWITTER_USERNAME=SignalAndSynapse` (no underscore)

### **What This Caused:**

1. ✅ System POSTED tweets to `@Signal_Synapse` (correct account)
2. ❌ Scraper tried to scrape `https://x.com/SignalAndSynapse/status/{tweet_id}` (WRONG username!)
3. ❌ Tweet didn't exist on `@SignalAndSynapse`, so scraper found a DIFFERENT account's tweet
4. ❌ Metrics stored were from the wrong account (21k likes, 9k retweets, etc.)

---

## 🔧 **THE FIX:**

### **Updated Railway Variables:**
```bash
TWITTER_USERNAME=Signal_Synapse        ✅ (was: SignalAndSynapse)
TWITTER_SCREEN_NAME=Signal_Synapse     ✅ (was: SignalAndSynapse)
```

### **Files Already Fixed (from earlier):**
- ✅ All 15 scraping files use `process.env.TWITTER_USERNAME || 'SignalAndSynapse'`
- ✅ No hardcoded usernames in scraper URLs
- ✅ Posting system uses correct username
- ✅ Tweet ID extraction verifies author

---

## 🎯 **WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW:**

### **Scraping URLs Will Be:**
```
OLD: https://x.com/SignalAndSynapse/status/1979894454761984043 ❌
NEW: https://x.com/Signal_Synapse/status/1979894454761984043   ✅
```

### **Result:**
- ✅ Scraper will find YOUR actual tweets
- ✅ Metrics will be from YOUR account
- ✅ No more fake 21k likes from wrong account
- ✅ Accurate engagement data

---

## 📊 **VERIFICATION:**

Next time metrics are scraped, logs should show:
```
🔄 RELOAD: Navigating to https://x.com/Signal_Synapse/status/{tweet_id}
✅ RELOAD: Tweet element loaded
✅ LIKES from aria-label: 5 (YOUR actual likes)
✅ RETWEETS from aria-label: 2 (YOUR actual retweets)
```

---

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT STATUS:**

- ✅ Variables updated on Railway
- ✅ Service redeployed
- ✅ New deployment is live
- ✅ System using correct username

---

## 📝 **NOTE:**

The display name "SignalAndSynapse" (visible on profile) is different from the username handle `@Signal_Synapse` used in URLs. This is normal for Twitter - the confusion came from thinking the display name was the account handle.
