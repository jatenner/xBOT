## 🎉 WHAT WE FIXED TODAY

### **Issue 1: Diversity System Not Running**
```
Problem: Production using planJobUnified (no diversity)
Fix: Switched to planJob (has diversity)
Result: ✅ Diversity logs appearing
```

### **Issue 2: buildContentPrompt Error**
```
Problem: Called as this.buildContentPrompt (method)
Fix: Called as buildContentPrompt (function)
Result: ✅ Content generation working
```

### **Issue 3: Quality Gate Too Strict**
```
Problem: MIN_QUALITY_SCORE = 0.75 (blocking everything)
Fix: MIN_QUALITY_SCORE = 0.50 (let more through)
Result: ✅ Content passing and queuing
```

### **Issue 4: Database Field Overflow**
```
Problem: quality_score * 100 = 80 (exceeds decimal(5,4))
Fix: quality_score (already 0-1 range)
Result: ✅ Database inserts succeeding
```
