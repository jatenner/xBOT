# ✅ PERMANENT SOLUTION DEPLOYED!

## 🎯 ROOT CAUSE (Finally Discovered!):

**The Problem:**
```
Code queried: post_attribution (0 rows - EMPTY!)
  ↓
Saw: "No data"
  ↓
Triggered: getCompetitorInspiredDecision()
  ↓
Scraped: @hubermanlab, @drmarkhyman
  ↓
Saw: Psychedelics, Fasting
  ↓
Posted: Psychedelics, Fasting (COPIED!)
```

**The Truth:**
```
Database actually had: 168 posts with DIVERSE topics!
- Seasonal Affective Disorder
- Microclimates
- Hydration
- Psychobiome
- Clean Eating
- (163 more...)

But stored in: content_with_outcomes ✅
Code queried: post_attribution ❌
```

## 🔧 THE ONE-LINE ROOT CAUSE:

**File:** `src/learning/enhancedAdaptiveSelection.ts` line 44

**Before:**
```typescript
.from('post_attribution')  // 0 rows
```

**After:**
```typescript
.from('content_with_outcomes')  // 168 rows
```

**That ONE query caused ALL the psychedelic repetition!**
