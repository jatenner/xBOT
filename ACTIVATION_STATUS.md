## 🎯 MONITORING PLAN

### **Next 30 Minutes:**
- [ ] Wait for plan job to run
- [ ] Watch for diversity system logs
- [ ] Verify logs show topic/angle/tone generation

### **After Plan Job Runs:**
- [ ] Check database for populated diversity fields
- [ ] Read the generated content
- [ ] Verify it's different from previous posts

### **After Post Goes Live:**
- [ ] Check Twitter @SignalAndSynapse
- [ ] Read the actual post
- [ ] Compare to previous posts (should be different!)
- [ ] Monitor engagement (views, likes)

---

## 📝 WHAT TO LOOK FOR

### **Success Indicators:**
```
✅ Diversity logs appear in Railway
✅ Topic is fresh/interesting (not "urban green spaces" again!)
✅ Angle and tone are populated
✅ Generator is randomly selected
✅ Database fields are NOT NULL
✅ Post sounds different from previous posts
```

### **Red Flags:**
```
❌ No diversity logs (means planJob not imported correctly)
❌ Topics still repetitive  
❌ Database fields still NULL
❌ Posts still sound the same
```

## 🚀 CURRENT STATE

**Deployment:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Diversity System:** ⏳ WAITING FOR PLAN JOB  
**ETA:** Within 30 minutes  
**Next Action:** Monitor logs for diversity system activation
