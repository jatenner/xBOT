1. **Burst Posting Crisis** 
   - ‚ùå **Same content posted 5 times**: "BREAKTHROUGH: Machine learning algorithms identify promising drug compounds..."
   - ‚ùå **Identical posts flooding timeline** instead of distributed throughout day
   - ‚ùå **No content variety** - all posts exactly the same

2. **Academic Content Blocking Viral Growth**
   - ‚ùå **0/5 posts contained viral indicators** ("Hot take:", "Unpopular opinion:")
