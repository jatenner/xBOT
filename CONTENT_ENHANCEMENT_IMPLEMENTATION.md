# üéØ CONTENT ENHANCEMENT IMPLEMENTATION

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive content quality improvements based on live post analysis  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

---

## üìã OVERVIEW

This implementation systematically addresses content quality issues identified in live Twitter posts, focusing on eliminating first-person language, enforcing specificity requirements, and establishing monitoring systems for continuous improvement.

---

## ‚ú® WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED

### **PHASE 1: CONTENT HYGIENE (Foundation Fix)**

#### 1.1 Shared Patterns Module
**File:** `src/generators/sharedPatterns.ts`

- **Banned Phrases List**: 30+ banned phrases including first-person language, vague expressions, and template phrases
- **Specificity Patterns**: Regex patterns to detect:
  - Percentages (e.g., "40% increase")
  - Dosages (e.g., "500mg", "10,000 lux")
  - Time ranges (e.g., "66 days", "18-254")
  - Study citations (e.g., "n=96", "Lally et al.")
  - Mechanisms (e.g., "triggers", "pathway", "metabolism")
- **Voice Guidelines**: Complete prompt section with:
  - Required elements (third-person, specific numbers, mechanisms)
  - Forbidden elements (first-person, anecdotes, templates)
  - Character limits (270 for single, 250 for thread)
  - Excellent examples vs bad examples

#### 1.2 Content Sanitizer
**File:** `src/generators/contentSanitizer.ts`

- **Post-Generation Filter**: Catches violations AFTER generation but BEFORE posting
- **4 Violation Types**:
  1. **First-person** (CRITICAL): "I", "me", "my", "worked for me", etc.
  2. **Banned phrases** (HIGH): "Who knew?", "Turns out", template language
  3. **Low specificity** (MEDIUM): No numbers, studies, or mechanisms
  4. **Incomplete sentences** (MEDIUM): Ellipsis, cut-off words
- **Auto-Retry Logic**: Retries with different generator for critical violations
- **Database Tracking**: Logs all violations for monitoring (integrated in Phase 4)

#### 1.3 HumanVoiceEngine Pattern Fixes
**File:** `src/ai/humanVoiceEngine.ts`

**Changed patterns (lines 69-119):**
- ‚ùå "Been diving deep into {topic}" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Deep analysis of {topic} reveals"
- ‚ùå "Found this fascinating study" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Recent {topic} study changes everything"
- ‚ùå "Tried this {topic} method" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Evidence reveals this {topic} method"
- ‚ùå "Found a better way" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Better approaches emerging from data"
- ‚ùå "Been questioning standard advice" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Recent analysis questions standard advice"

**Result**: Removed all first-person language from `research_enthusiast`, `practical_optimizer`, and `curious_investigator` voice styles.

#### 1.4 UnifiedContentEngine Integration
**File:** `src/unified/UnifiedContentEngine.ts`

**Added Step 5.5 - Content Sanitization (lines 187-229):**
```typescript
// After content generation, before quality validation
1. Run sanitizeContent() on generated content
2. If violations detected:
   - Log violations to database
   - Auto-retry with different generator (critical violations)
   - Reject if retry also fails
3. If passed: Continue to quality validation
```

**Key features:**
- Integrated between generation and quality validation
- Uses retry logic to avoid rejecting good ideas with bad execution
- Tracks all violations for monitoring
- Uses `finalContent` for enrichment and quality checks

---

### **PHASE 2: GENERATOR PROMPT ENHANCEMENT**

**Updated all 12 generators** with shared voice guidelines:

| Generator | File | Key Addition |
|-----------|------|--------------|
| 1. Contrarian | `contrarianGenerator.ts` | Added `VOICE_GUIDELINES` after line 26 |
| 2. Provocateur | `provocateurGenerator.ts` | Added `VOICE_GUIDELINES` after line 25 |
| 3. News Reporter | `newsReporterGenerator.ts` | Added `VOICE_GUIDELINES` after line 32 |
| 4. Interesting | `interestingContentGenerator.ts` | Added `VOICE_GUIDELINES` after line 30 |
| 5. Explorer | `explorerGenerator.ts` | Added `VOICE_GUIDELINES` after line 25 |
| 6. Data Nerd | `dataNerdGenerator.ts` | Added `VOICE_GUIDELINES` after line 25 |
| 7. Coach | `coachGenerator.ts` | Added `VOICE_GUIDELINES` after line 25 |
| 8. Thought Leader | `thoughtLeaderGenerator.ts` | Added `VOICE_GUIDELINES` after line 24 |
| 9. Myth Buster | `mythBusterGenerator.ts` | Added `VOICE_GUIDELINES` after line 24 |
| 10. Storyteller | `storytellerGenerator.ts` | Added `VOICE_GUIDELINES` after line 24 |
| 11. Philosopher | `philosopherGenerator.ts` | Added `VOICE_GUIDELINES` after line 24 |
| 12. Viral Thread | `viralThreadGenerator.ts` | Added `VOICE_GUIDELINES` in `buildViralPrompt()` |

**Result**: Every generator now receives consistent voice requirements with every generation request.

---

### **PHASE 3: VALUE-ADD ENHANCEMENTS**

#### 3.1 Content Enricher (Optional Feature)
**File:** `src/generators/contentEnricher.ts`

**Purpose**: Add "vs conventional wisdom" contrast to 60% of posts

**How it works:**
1. Receives generated content after sanitization passes
2. 60% probability (or forced): Calls GPT-4 to add contrast angle
3. Example enhancement:
   - **Before**: "Fasting initiates autophagy, clearing damaged cells."
   - **After**: "Fasting initiates autophagy, clearing damaged cells. Most people focus on WHEN to eat. Few realize fasting works BECAUSE of cellular cleanup, not calorie restriction."
4. Validates character limits (270 single, 250 thread)
5. Returns original if enrichment would exceed limits

**Status**: Implemented but **DISABLED by default**
- Enable with: `request.enableEnrichment = true` in UnifiedContentEngine
- Integrated at Step 5.7 (lines 222-252)

**Why disabled**: Testing sanitization first, then enabling enrichment after baseline metrics established.

#### 3.2 Enhanced Quality Controller
**File:** `src/quality/contentQualityController.ts`

**Added specificity check** to `detectCriticalIssues()` (lines 336-349):

```typescript
// Checks for at least ONE of:
// - Study citation (Lally et al. 2009)
// - Measurement (10,000 lux, 500mg, 16:8)
// - Timeframe (66 days, 18-254 range)
// - Percentage (40% increase)
// - Mechanism (480nm ‚Üí ipRGC ‚Üí SCN)

if (specificityCheck.score === 0) {
  issues.push('NO_SPECIFICITY: Must include study citation, measurement, or mechanism');
}
```

**Result**: Content without ANY specific numbers/studies/mechanisms is instantly rejected.

---

### **PHASE 4: MONITORING & TRACKING**

#### 4.1 Database Migration
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251018170436_content_violations_tracking.sql`

**Created table: `content_violations`**

Tracks every sanitization violation with:
- Generator name (which generator produced the violation)
- Violation type (first_person, banned_phrase, low_specificity, incomplete)
- Severity (critical, high, medium, low)
- Detected phrase and context
- Full content (for analysis)
- Specificity score and matches
- Action taken (rejected, retried, posted_anyway)
- Retry success status

**Created materialized view: `generator_quality_metrics`**

Pre-computed metrics per generator:
- Total violations
- Violations by type
- Critical violation count
- Rejection rate
- Successful retry rate
- Average specificity score
- First/last violation timestamps

**Useful queries included:**
```sql
-- Top violators (last 7 days)
-- First-person violations by generator
-- Improvement over time
```

**Refresh command:**
```sql
SELECT refresh_generator_quality_metrics();
```

#### 4.2 Violation Tracking Integration
**File:** `src/generators/contentSanitizer.ts` (lines 226-271)

**Added `trackViolation()` function:**
- Logs violations to Supabase `content_violations` table
- Fire-and-forget (doesn't block generation)
- Includes full context for analysis

**Integrated in UnifiedContentEngine** (lines 201-214):
- Automatically tracks all violations when detected
- Includes generator name, topic, format
- Records action taken (retry vs reject)

SELECT generator_name, COUNT(*) as violations
FROM content_violations
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY generator_name
ORDER BY violations DESC;

-- Quality trend
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as day,
  COUNT(*) as total_violations,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE severity = 'critical') as critical
FROM content_violations
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY day;
```

**Weekly review:**
```sql
-- Refresh materialized view
SELECT refresh_generator_quality_metrics();

-- Review generator quality
SELECT * FROM generator_quality_metrics
ORDER BY total_violations DESC;
```

## üî¨ TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Manual Testing (Before Going Live)

**Test first-person detection:**
```typescript
// Should be rejected
const badContent = "I tried intermittent fasting and it worked for me";

// Should pass
const goodContent = "Intermittent fasting 16:8 (eat 12pm-8pm) + 500mg NMN daily";
```

**Test specificity requirement:**
```typescript
// Should be rejected (no specifics)
const vague = "Fasting is good for health. Try it!";

// Should pass (has specifics)
const specific = "Lally et al. 2009 (n=96): Average 66 days to form habit";
```

**Test banned phrases:**
```typescript
// Should be rejected
const template = "Let's dive deep into the science of fasting...";

// Should pass
const direct = "Fasting initiates autophagy. Here's the mechanism:";
```

### Automated Testing

**Run post generation test:**
```bash
# Test single post generation
pnpm run post-now

# Check logs for sanitization messages
tail -f logs/main.log | grep "SANITIZATION"
```

**Check database:**
```sql
-- After test generation, check for violations
SELECT * FROM content_violations
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

### High Rejection Rate (>40%)
**Cause**: Generators producing low-quality content  
**Fix**: Lower MIN_QUALITY_SCORE temporarily OR improve generator prompts

### First-person Still Appearing
**Cause**: Pattern not caught by sanitizer  
**Fix**: Add pattern to `detectFirstPerson()` in contentSanitizer.ts

### Too Many Specificity Violations
**Cause**: Patterns too strict  
**Fix**: Adjust `REQUIRED_PATTERNS` in sharedPatterns.ts

### Database Tracking Not Working
**Cause**: Migration not applied OR Supabase connection issue  
**Fix**: 
```bash
# Check if table exists
psql -c "\d content_violations"

# Check Supabase connection
echo $SUPABASE_URL
```
