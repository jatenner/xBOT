## 📝 **CONTENT GENERATION CYCLE (Every 2.5 Hours)**

### **Job: planJobNew.ts**

```typescript
STEP 1: Job Trigger
⏰ Timer fires every 2.5 hours
📊 Checks if MODE=live (not shadow/dry-run)
💰 Validates OpenAI budget ($5/day limit)

STEP 2: Content Type Selection (Thompson Sampling)
🎲 Algorithm: Thompson Sampling (Multi-Armed Bandit)
📊 Tracks performance of 9 content types:
   - Educational Thread
   - Fact Bomb
   - Case Study
   - News Reaction
   - Study Breakdown
   - Quick Tip
   - Myth Buster
   - Personal Experience
   - Challenge/Experiment

How it picks:
   - Each type has success_count and total_count
   - Samples from Beta distribution: Beta(success + 1, failure + 1)
   - Picks type with highest sample (exploration + exploitation)
   - Occasionally explores (30% chance) less-used types
   
Example:
   Educational Thread: 15 successes / 20 attempts = 75% win rate
   Myth Buster: 8 successes / 10 attempts = 80% win rate
   → Slightly favors Myth Buster but still tries others

STEP 3: Hook Selection (Genetic Algorithm)
🧬 Hook Evolution Engine:
   - Database stores ~5-20 hooks with performance data
   - Each hook has: text, generation, fitness_score, times_used
   - Algorithm picks based on fitness + diversity
   
Selection Process:
   1. Load all hooks from database
   2. Calculate scores: fitness × (1 - recent_use_penalty)
   3. Pick top performer with 70% probability
   4. Or explore new hook with 30% probability
   
Hooks evolve over time:
   - Good hooks (high engagement) → higher fitness
   - Bad hooks (low engagement) → lower fitness
   - New variations created by "mutating" successful hooks

STEP 4: Topic Selection (16 Categories)
🎯 Topic Expansion System:
   Categories: health, nutrition, fitness, sleep, mental_health,
              longevity, biohacking, supplements, research, 
              myth_busting, performance, recovery, disease_prevention,
              lifestyle, mindfulness, aging
   
   Selection:
   - Tracks which topics got followers
   - Uses Thompson Sampling per topic
   - Balances variety with proven winners

STEP 5: Personality Selection (10 Generators)
🎭 Content Orchestrator picks from:
   1. Educator (clear, structured, authoritative)
   2. Scientist (data-driven, technical, precise)
   3. Storyteller (narrative, engaging, relatable)
   4. Contrarian (challenges norms, provocative)
   5. Pragmatist (actionable, no-nonsense, direct)
   6. Futurist (cutting-edge, forward-thinking)
   7. Historian (context, evolution, perspective)
   8. Skeptic (critical thinking, evidence-focused)
   9. Optimist (hopeful, solution-oriented)
   10. Comedian (witty, entertaining, memorable)

How it picks:
   - Tracks follower_gain per generator
   - Uses performance data + diversity requirement
   - Ensures variety (no same generator twice in a row)

STEP 6: Content Generation (OpenAI API)
🤖 Master Content Generator:
   
   Input to OpenAI:
   {
     model: "gpt-4o-mini",
     temperature: 0.8-0.9 (creative but controlled),
     content_type: "Educational Thread",
     hook_guidance: "Most people think X, but research shows Y",
     topic: "sleep optimization",
     personality: "Scientist",
     format: "thread" or "single"
   }
   
   System Prompt (Massive, 500+ lines):
   - Defines personality voice
   - Includes viral formulas
   - Specifies formatting rules
   - Bans generic phrases
   - Requires specific numbers
   - Demands credibility signals
   - Enforces character limits (230 chars/tweet, 280 max)
   
   User Prompt:
   "Generate a thread about [topic] using [personality] voice,
    opening with [hook style], including specific research,
    actionable insights, and compelling CTA"
   
   OpenAI Response:
   {
     "content": ["tweet1", "tweet2", "tweet3", ...],
     "format": "thread",
     "confidence": 0.85
   }

STEP 7: Quality Validation (Multiple Gates)
✅ Quality Gate Chain:
   
   Gate 1: Duplicate Detection
   - Checks last 100 posts for cosine similarity
   - Threshold: 90% similarity = reject
   - Uses TF-IDF vectors for comparison
   
   Gate 2: Generic Phrase Filter
   - Banned phrases: "it's not just about", "the key is",
                      "at the end of the day", "game changer"
   - If detected → warning or reject
   
   Gate 3: Viral Scoring (0-100)
   Calculates score based on:
   - Hook strength (15 points): Controversial? Specific?
   - Specificity (25 points): Numbers? Studies? Names?
   - Controversy (20 points): Challenges beliefs?
   - Actionability (20 points): Clear steps? Immediate value?
   - Format (10 points): Proper thread? Good breaks?
   - CTA (10 points): Clear follow ask?
   
   Minimum score: 60 to pass
   
   Gate 4: Length Validation
   - Single tweets: ≤280 chars
   - Thread tweets: ≤230 chars each
   - Total thread: 3-8 tweets
   
   Gate 5: Content Formatter
   - Removes numbered lists (1., 2., 3.)
   - Removes bold formatting (**text**)
   - Adds natural breaks
   - Ensures Twitter-native feel

STEP 8: Prediction (Ridge Regression)
📈 Performance Predictor:
   
   Features used:
   - Content type
   - Hook used
   - Topic category  
   - Hour posted
   - Day of week
   - Historical performance
   
   Predictions:
   - Engagement rate (likes + RTs / impressions)
   - Follower gain (how many followers expected)
   - Viral probability (chance of >1K engagement)
   
   Algorithm: Ridge Regression
   - Trained on historical post data
   - Updates every hour as new data comes in
   - Coefficients stored in Redis

STEP 9: Scheduling Decision
⏰ When to post:
   
   Optimal times (learned from data):
   - 7-9 AM (morning commute)
   - 12-2 PM (lunch break)
   - 7-9 PM (evening scroll)
   
   Spacing:
   - Minimum 30 min between posts
   - Maximum 3 posts/hour
   - Stagger throughout day
   
   Calculated as:
   scheduledTime = now + randomOffset(30-120 min)

STEP 10: Database Storage
💾 Stores in content_metadata table:
   {
     decision_id: UUID,
     content: "full post text",
     bandit_arm: "edu_thread_scientist",
     timing_arm: "morning_optimal",
     scheduled_at: "2025-10-17 08:30:00",
     quality_score: 0.85,
     predicted_er: 0.042,
     predicted_followers: 12,
     topic_cluster: "sleep",
     generation_source: "orchestrator",
     features: {
       thread_tweets: ["tweet1", "tweet2", ...],
       hook_used: "research_contradiction",
       generator: "scientist",
       viral_score: 78
     },
     status: "ready_for_posting"
   }

STEP 11: Attribution Initialization
📊 Post Attribution Setup:
   - Creates record in post_attribution table
   - Captures follower_count_before
   - Sets up tracking for T+2h, T+24h, T+48h
   - Links to decision_id for learning

RESULT: 2 high-quality posts queued for posting

   neuroscience → "add_study"
   longevity → "extend_insight"
   nutrition → "counterpoint"
   fitness → "extend_insight"
   sleep → "add_study"
   mental_health → "ask_question"
   biohacking → "add_study"
   wellness → "extend_insight"

STEP 4: Reply Generation
🤖 Strategic Reply System:
   
   Finds titan's latest tweet (mock for now, will be real scraping)
   
   Generates reply using OpenAI:
   {
     model: "gpt-4o-mini",
     temperature: 0.7,
     titan_username: "@hubermanlab",
     tweet_content: "Sleep is crucial for...",
     reply_strategy: "add_study",
     our_niche: "health_optimization"
   }
   
   System Prompt:
   "You're replying to a high-value account with 2.5M followers.
    Your goal: Add genuine value, not spam.
    Strategy: Add a study they didn't mention.
    Rules:
    - Be respectful and humble
    - Add NEW information (don't just agree)
    - Cite specific research
    - Keep under 280 characters
    - Don't be promotional
    - Provide immediate value"
   
   User Prompt:
   "Reply to @hubermanlab's tweet about sleep.
    Add a study from Dr. Walker's research that extends their point.
    Make it scannable and insightful."
   
   OpenAI Response:
   "Adding to this: Dr. Walker's research shows sleep debt
    compounds exponentially. Missing 1h/night = 7h deficit/week,
    but recovery requires 1:1 sleep surplus over weeks, not just
    'catching up' on weekends."

STEP 5: Quality Validation
✅ Reply quality checks:
   
   - Not spam? (no "great post!", "I agree!")
   - Adds value? (new information, insight, question)
   - Not too long? (≤280 chars)
   - Not too promotional? (no "check out my...")
   - Respectful? (no attacks, no snark)
   
   If fails any check → reject, try next opportunity

STEP 6: Gate Chain
🚪 Same quality gates as content:
   - Duplicate detection
   - Generic phrase filter
   - Length validation

STEP 7: Queue for Posting

   Current time: 2025-10-17 08:35:00
   Minutes since posted: 35
   
   If ≥30 min:
     velocity_30min = likes + RTs + replies
   
   If ≥120 min:
     velocity_2hours = engagement_count
   
   If ≥1440 min:
     velocity_24hours = engagement_count
   
   Velocity score:
   if (velocity_30min > 0):
     score = min(100, velocity_30min * 10)
   else:
     score = min(100, velocity_2hours * 2)

STEP 4: Funnel Analysis
📈 Conversion tracking:
   
   views = scraped_views
   impressions = views * 1.5  // estimate
   profile_clicks = views * 0.05  // 5% estimate
   
   view_rate = views / impressions
   click_rate = profile_clicks / views
   follow_rate = followers_gained / profile_clicks
   
   funnel_efficiency = (view_rate * click_rate * follow_rate) * 100

STEP 5: Database Storage
💾 Stores in multiple tables:
   
   tweet_outcomes:
   - Basic metrics (likes, RTs, replies, views)
   
   multi_dimensional_metrics:

   SELECT * FROM multi_dimensional_metrics
   WHERE updated_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'

STEP 2: Thompson Sampling Update
🎲 For each content type:
   
   Educational Thread:
   - success_count = posts with ≥40 followers gained
   - failure_count = posts with <40 followers gained
   - success_rate = success / total
   
   Update Beta distribution parameters:
   alpha = success_count + 1
   beta = failure_count + 1
   
   Next selection will sample from Beta(alpha, beta)

STEP 3: Hook Performance Update
🧬 Genetic Algorithm learning:
   
   For each hook used:
   engagement = likes + retweets + replies
   followers_gained = from attribution data
   
   fitness_score = (followers_gained * 10) + (engagement / 100)
   
   UPDATE evolved_hooks
   SET fitness_score = new_fitness,
       times_used = times_used + 1,
       last_used_at = posted_at
   WHERE hook_id = 'xxx'
   
   If fitness < 20 after 5+ uses:
     → Mark for mutation or removal

STEP 4: Multi-Dimensional Analysis
📈 Algorithm scoring:
   
   For each post:
   
   Twitter Algorithm Score (0-100):
   = velocity_score × 0.4
   + engagement_quality × 0.3
   + network_effects × 0.2
   + conversation_depth × 0.1
   
   Follower Conversion Score (0-100):
   = view_rate_score × 0.2
   + click_rate_score × 0.3
   + follow_rate_score × 0.5
   
   Overall Effectiveness:
   = twitter_score × 0.6 + conversion_score × 0.4

STEP 5: Pattern Recognition
🔍 Extracts insights:
   
   Velocity patterns:
   posts_with_high_velocity = score > avg × 1.5
   if (count > 10):
     insight = "Posts with engagement in first 30min get
                {ratio}x better reach"
   
   Timing patterns:
   best_hours = hours with avg_effectiveness > 70
   insight = "Posting at {hour}:00 performs {score}%
              above average"
   
   Funnel patterns:
   high_conversion_posts = click_rate > avg × 2
   insight = "This content type gets {ratio}x more
              profile clicks"

STEP 6: Titan Performance Update
🎯 Reply learning:
   
   For each titan replied to:
   
   UPDATE titan_accounts
   SET times_replied = times_replied + 1,
       followers_gained = followers_gained + new_followers,
       conversion_rate = followers_gained / times_replied
   WHERE username = '@hubermanlab'
   
   Rank titans by conversion_rate for next cycle

STEP 7: Predictor Retraining
📊 Ridge Regression update:
   
   Features: [content_type, hook, topic, hour, day]
   Target: followers_gained
   
   X = feature_matrix (all posts, normalized)
   y = follower_gains (all posts)
   
   model = RidgeRegression(alpha=1.0)
   model.fit(X, y)
   
   coefficients = model.coef_
   
   Store in Redis:
   redis.set('predictor_coefficients', JSON.stringify(coefficients))

STEP 8: Insights Storage
💡 Stores actionable insights:
   
   INSERT INTO meta_insights
   (insight_type, discovery, confidence, sample_size,
    actionable_recommendation, created_at)
   VALUES
   ('velocity', 'Early engagement = 2.3x reach', 0.85, 47,
    'Post during high-activity hours', NOW())

RESULT: System gets smarter every hour
        Future content optimized based on real data
        Titans ranked by actual conversion
        Predictions improve continuously
