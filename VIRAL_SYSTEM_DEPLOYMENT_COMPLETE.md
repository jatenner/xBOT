🚨 BREAKTHROUGH: Machine learning algorithms identify 12 cancer types with 94% sensitivity at stages I-II. Analyzed 15K+ patients, 98.5% specificity with 0.7% false positives in 100K+ controls (Nature Medicine, 2024).
```

### **New Viral Pattern**
```
Plot twist: After analyzing 15K+ patients, AI detects 12 cancer types better than doctors.

94% sensitivity at early stages. 98.5% specificity.

But here's what everyone's missing: The 0.7% false positive rate could save more lives than perfect accuracy.

Thoughts?
