# 🔍 **DEPLOYMENT STATUS CHECK**

## **CURRENT LOGS ANALYSIS:**

### **Evidence from Logs:**
```
[POSTING_QUEUE] ⚠️ No queued content found in database at all
[POSTING_QUEUE] ℹ️ No decisions ready for posting (grace_window=5m)
```

### **Missing from Logs:**
```
❌ No "🚀 STARTUP: Running immediate plan job" messages
❌ No "✅ JOB_MANAGER: All timers started" messages
❌ No "🏥 HEALTH_CHECK" messages
❌ No "attempt 1/3" retry messages
```

## **DIAGNOSIS:**

### **Scenario 1: Railway Still Building**
Railway might still be building/deploying the new code.
- Git push succeeded
- Railway needs time to:
  1. Pull new code
  2. Build Docker image
  3. Deploy to production
  4. Restart service

### **Scenario 2: Deployment Complete But Not Restarted**
Railway deployed but the old process is still running.
- May need manual restart

### **Scenario 3: Build Failed**
TypeScript compilation or deployment failed.
- Check Railway build logs

---

## **VERIFICATION STEPS:**

1. **Check Railway Status:**
   ```bash
   railway status
   ```

2. **Check Recent Logs for Build/Deploy Messages:**
   ```bash
   railway logs | grep -E "build|deploy|Starting"
   ```

3. **If Old Code Still Running:**
   ```bash
   railway restart
   ```

4. **Monitor After Restart:**
   ```bash
   railway logs --tail
   ```

---

## **EXPECTED AFTER DEPLOYMENT:**

Within 2-3 minutes of deployment, you should see:
```
🕒 JOB_MANAGER: Initializing job timers...
✅ JOB_MANAGER: All timers started successfully
🚀 STARTUP: Running immediate plan job to populate queue...
   (attempt 1/3 messages if retrying)
✅ STARTUP: Initial plan job completed
🏥 HEALTH_CHECK: Starting content pipeline health monitor
🕒 JOB_PLAN: Starting...
[UNIFIED_PLAN] 🎯 Starting unified content planning...
```

If you DON'T see these messages, the new code hasn't deployed yet.

---

## **ACTION REQUIRED:**

Waiting for Railway to finish deployment. If after 2-3 minutes you still see old logs, run:

```bash
railway restart
```

This will force Railway to restart the service with the new code.
