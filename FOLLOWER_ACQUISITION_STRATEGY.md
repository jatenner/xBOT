# 🎯 WEEK 1: 10 FOLLOWERS ACQUISITION STRATEGY

## CURRENT STATUS
- **Bot**: ✅ Live on Render, posting intermittently
- **Issues**: Quality gate failures, rate limiting, 403 errors
- **Target**: 10 followers by end of week
- **Timeline**: 7 days

---

## 📊 PHASE 1: SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION (Days 1-2)

### Immediate Fixes Required:

#### 1. **Quality Gate Relaxation**
```sql
-- Apply migration: 20250630_follower_optimization.sql
-- Lowers readability from 45→35, credibility 0.8→0.4
-- Removes URL/citation requirements
-- Increases daily tweets 8→12
```

#### 2. **Rate Limit Resolution**
- **Issue**: `Request failed with code 429` and `403`
- **Solution**: Implement exponential backoff (already done in supabaseClient.ts)
- **Monitor**: `/logs` for API errors

#### 3. **Posting Frequency Optimization**
- **Current**: Sporadic posting due to quality failures
- **Target**: 8-12 tweets/day (every 2-3 hours)
- **Strategy**: Lower quality bar temporarily to increase volume
