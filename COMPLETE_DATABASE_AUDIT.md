- Oct 26: 30 posts with full diversity (62.5% of today's 48 posts)
- Oct 25: 0 posts with diversity (0%)
- Oct 24: 0 posts with diversity (0%)
```

**DIAGNOSIS:**
```
✅ Generator names: Always tracked (even old system)
✅ NEW diversity fields: Working since TODAY (Oct 26)
⚠️ Only 62.5% of TODAY's posts have diversity (should be 100%)

WHY: Diversity system activated ~3pm today
Posts created before 3pm: No diversity (old system)

```

---

### **AUDIT #2: Engagement Metrics Scraping**

**Last 48 Hours Posted Content:**
```
Total posts: 120
Posts with metrics scraped: 84 (70%)
Posts missing metrics: 36 (30%)

Metrics collected:
- Views (impressions): 84/120 (70%)
- Likes: 84/120 (70%)
- Replies: 84/120 (70%)

Average engagement:
- Views: 374.3 avg (MAX: 12,000!) 🔥

- Max views: 12,000 is HUGE!
```

**DIAGNOSIS:**
```
✅ Metrics scraping: WORKING (70% coverage)
⚠️ 30% missing metrics

Reasons for missing 30%:
1. Posts too recent (scraped within 30min-2 hours)
2. Scraper hasn't run yet on those posts
3. Some scraping failures (timeouts)

STATUS: ACCEPTABLE (70% is good, will improve to 90%+ as scrapers catch up)
```

---

### **AUDIT #3: Posted Decisions Tracking**

**Last 48 Hours:**
```
Total records: 102
Decision types: 2 (single, reply)
With tweet_id: 102/102 (100%) ✅

```
Total opportunities: 30
With tweet content: 30/30 (100%) ✅
With opportunity score: 30/30 (100%) ✅
Created last 24h: 30/30 (100%)
Most recent: 18 minutes ago

Status: EXCELLENT - Reply harvester working perfectly!
```

**DIAGNOSIS:**
```
✅ Reply opportunities: Being harvested regularly
✅ Tweet content: Always captured (100%)
✅ Scoring: Always calculated (100%)
✅ Fresh data: All from last 24h

Reply system is SOLID!
```

---

### **AUDIT #5: Data Completeness by Post**

**Last 24 Hours (15 Recent Posts):**

**Singles (Content Posts):**
```
Post 1: ✅ content, ✅ topic, ✅ angle, ✅ tone, ✅ generator, ❌ views, ❌ likes
Post 2: ✅ content, ✅ topic, ✅ angle, ✅ tone, ✅ generator, ❌ views, ❌ likes
Post 3: ✅ content, ✅ topic, ✅ angle, ✅ tone, ✅ generator, ❌ views, ❌ likes
Post 4: ✅ content, ✅ topic, ✅ angle, ✅ tone, ✅ generator, ✅ views, ✅ likes

Recent singles (with diversity): 100% have topic/angle/tone! ✅
Recent singles (metrics): 25% have metrics (too new, scrapers running)
```

**Replies:**
```
Post 1: ✅ content, ❌ topic, ❌ angle, ❌ tone, ✅ generator, ❌ views, ❌ likes
Post 2: ✅ content, ❌ topic, ❌ angle, ❌ tone, ✅ generator, ❌ views, ❌ likes
Post 3: ✅ content, ❌ topic, ❌ angle, ❌ tone, ✅ generator, ✅ views, ✅ likes

Replies: Don't use diversity system (expected - different workflow)
Replies: Some have metrics, some don't (scraper lag)
```

**DIAGNOSIS:**
```
✅ Content posts (singles/threads): Full diversity tracking ✅
❌ Replies: No diversity tracking (expected - replies use different system)
⚠️ Metrics: 1-2 hour lag (normal - scrapers run on schedule)
```

---

### **AUDIT #6: Outcomes Table (Learning Data)**

**Last 48 Hours:**
```
Total outcome records: 954
With likes data: 128 (13.4%)
With views data: 128 (13.4%)
With impressions: 128 (13.4%)
With collection timestamp: 954 (100%) ✅

Most recent collection: 1 minute ago
```

**DIAGNOSIS:**
```
✅ Outcomes table: Being populated
✅ Collection timestamps: Always recorded
⚠️ Only 13.4% have actual metrics

This is NORMAL because:
- Outcomes table creates placeholder records for ALL posts
- Metrics filled in later by scrapers
- 128/954 = 13% filled is reasonable for 48h window
- Older posts get scraped first, newer ones pending
```

---

### **AUDIT #7: Cross-Reference (Data Integrity)**

**Last 24 Hours:**
```
content_metadata (status='posted'): 79 posts
posted_decisions: 63 posts

Mismatch: 79 - 63 = 16 posts ⚠️
```

**What This Means:**
```
⚠️ 16 posts marked as "posted" in content_metadata
   But NOT recorded in posted_decisions

Possible reasons:
1. Recent posts (posted in last few min, not yet in posted_decisions)
2. Posting succeeded but posted_decisions insert failed
3. Data sync lag between tables
4. Replies might be tracked differently

Need to investigate: Which 16 posts are missing?
```

---

### **AUDIT #8: Diversity Data Quality (Recent Posts)**

**Last 12 Hours Sample:**
```
Post 1:
  Topic: "Apigenin: A Flavonoid Slayer Against Oxidative Stress"

### **AUDIT #4: Reply System Data**

**Last 48 Hours:**
```
Total opportunities: 30
With tweet content: 30/30 (100%) ✅
With opportunity score: 30/30 (100%) ✅
Created last 24h: 30/30 (100%)
Most recent: 18 minutes ago

Status: EXCELLENT - Reply harvester working perfectly!
```

**DIAGNOSIS:**
```
✅ Reply opportunities: Being harvested regularly
✅ Tweet content: Always captured (100%)
✅ Scoring: Always calculated (100%)
✅ Fresh data: All from last 24h

Reply system is SOLID!
```

---

### **AUDIT #5: Data Completeness by Post**

**Last 24 Hours (15 Recent Posts):**

**Singles (Content Posts):**
```
Post 1: ✅ content, ✅ topic, ✅ angle, ✅ tone, ✅ generator, ❌ views, ❌ likes
Post 2: ✅ content, ✅ topic, ✅ angle, ✅ tone, ✅ generator, ❌ views, ❌ likes
Post 3: ✅ content, ✅ topic, ✅ angle, ✅ tone, ✅ generator, ❌ views, ❌ likes
Post 4: ✅ content, ✅ topic, ✅ angle, ✅ tone, ✅ generator, ✅ views, ✅ likes

Recent singles (with diversity): 100% have topic/angle/tone! ✅
Recent singles (metrics): 25% have metrics (too new, scrapers running)
```

**Replies:**
```
Post 1: ✅ content, ❌ topic, ❌ angle, ❌ tone, ✅ generator, ❌ views, ❌ likes
Post 2: ✅ content, ❌ topic, ❌ angle, ❌ tone, ✅ generator, ❌ views, ❌ likes
Post 3: ✅ content, ❌ topic, ❌ angle, ❌ tone, ✅ generator, ✅ views, ✅ likes

Replies: Don't use diversity system (expected - different workflow)
Replies: Some have metrics, some don't (scraper lag)
```

**DIAGNOSIS:**
```
✅ Content posts (singles/threads): Full diversity tracking ✅
❌ Replies: No diversity tracking (expected - replies use different system)
⚠️ Metrics: 1-2 hour lag (normal - scrapers run on schedule)
```

---

### **AUDIT #6: Outcomes Table (Learning Data)**

**Last 48 Hours:**
```
Total outcome records: 954
With likes data: 128 (13.4%)
With views data: 128 (13.4%)
With impressions: 128 (13.4%)
With collection timestamp: 954 (100%) ✅

Most recent collection: 1 minute ago
```

**DIAGNOSIS:**
```
✅ Outcomes table: Being populated
✅ Collection timestamps: Always recorded
⚠️ Only 13.4% have actual metrics

This is NORMAL because:
- Outcomes table creates placeholder records for ALL posts
- Metrics filled in later by scrapers
- 128/954 = 13% filled is reasonable for 48h window
- Older posts get scraped first, newer ones pending
```

---

### **AUDIT #7: Cross-Reference (Data Integrity)**

**Last 24 Hours:**
```
content_metadata (status='posted'): 79 posts
posted_decisions: 63 posts

Mismatch: 79 - 63 = 16 posts ⚠️
```

**What This Means:**
```
⚠️ 16 posts marked as "posted" in content_metadata
   But NOT recorded in posted_decisions

Possible reasons:
1. Recent posts (posted in last few min, not yet in posted_decisions)
2. Posting succeeded but posted_decisions insert failed
3. Data sync lag between tables
4. Replies might be tracked differently

Need to investigate: Which 16 posts are missing?
```

---

### **AUDIT #8: Diversity Data Quality (Recent Posts)**

**Last 12 Hours Sample:**
```
Post 1:
  Topic: "Apigenin: A Flavonoid Slayer Against Oxidative Stress"
  Angle: "Comparative analysis of apigenin concentrations in culinary herbs"
  Tone: "Earthy wisdom with grounded, gentle storytelling"

**Last 48 Hours:**
```
Total opportunities: 30
With tweet content: 30/30 (100%) ✅
With opportunity score: 30/30 (100%) ✅
Created last 24h: 30/30 (100%)

```
✅ Reply opportunities: Being harvested regularly
✅ Tweet content: Always captured (100%)
✅ Scoring: Always calculated (100%)
✅ Fresh data: All from last 24h

Reply system is SOLID!
```

---

### **AUDIT #5: Data Completeness by Post**

**Last 24 Hours (15 Recent Posts):**

**Singles (Content Posts):**
```
Post 1: ✅ content, ✅ topic, ✅ angle, ✅ tone, ✅ generator, ❌ views, ❌ likes
Post 2: ✅ content, ✅ topic, ✅ angle, ✅ tone, ✅ generator, ❌ views, ❌ likes
Post 3: ✅ content, ✅ topic, ✅ angle, ✅ tone, ✅ generator, ❌ views, ❌ likes
Post 4: ✅ content, ✅ topic, ✅ angle, ✅ tone, ✅ generator, ✅ views, ✅ likes

Recent singles (with diversity): 100% have topic/angle/tone! ✅
Recent singles (metrics): 25% have metrics (too new, scrapers running)
```

**Replies:**
```
Post 1: ✅ content, ❌ topic, ❌ angle, ❌ tone, ✅ generator, ❌ views, ❌ likes
Post 2: ✅ content, ❌ topic, ❌ angle, ❌ tone, ✅ generator, ❌ views, ❌ likes
Post 3: ✅ content, ❌ topic, ❌ angle, ❌ tone, ✅ generator, ✅ views, ✅ likes

Replies: Don't use diversity system (expected - different workflow)
Replies: Some have metrics, some don't (scraper lag)
```

**DIAGNOSIS:**
```
✅ Content posts (singles/threads): Full diversity tracking ✅
❌ Replies: No diversity tracking (expected - replies use different system)
⚠️ Metrics: 1-2 hour lag (normal - scrapers run on schedule)
```

---

### **AUDIT #6: Outcomes Table (Learning Data)**

**Last 48 Hours:**
```
Total outcome records: 954
With likes data: 128 (13.4%)
With views data: 128 (13.4%)
With impressions: 128 (13.4%)
With collection timestamp: 954 (100%) ✅

Most recent collection: 1 minute ago
```

**DIAGNOSIS:**
```
✅ Outcomes table: Being populated
✅ Collection timestamps: Always recorded
⚠️ Only 13.4% have actual metrics

This is NORMAL because:
- Outcomes table creates placeholder records for ALL posts
- Metrics filled in later by scrapers
- 128/954 = 13% filled is reasonable for 48h window
- Older posts get scraped first, newer ones pending
```

---

### **AUDIT #7: Cross-Reference (Data Integrity)**

**Last 24 Hours:**
```
content_metadata (status='posted'): 79 posts
posted_decisions: 63 posts

Mismatch: 79 - 63 = 16 posts ⚠️
```

**What This Means:**
```
⚠️ 16 posts marked as "posted" in content_metadata
   But NOT recorded in posted_decisions

Possible reasons:
1. Recent posts (posted in last few min, not yet in posted_decisions)
2. Posting succeeded but posted_decisions insert failed
3. Data sync lag between tables
4. Replies might be tracked differently

Need to investigate: Which 16 posts are missing?
```

---

### **AUDIT #8: Diversity Data Quality (Recent Posts)**

**Last 12 Hours Sample:**
```
Post 1:
  Topic: "Apigenin: A Flavonoid Slayer Against Oxidative Stress"
