### üìä Real Metrics & Monitoring
- **FIXED**: Eliminated "browser unavailable" spam in production

### üîß Technical Improvements
- **NEW**: `src/db/client.ts` - centralized database client with verified SSL
- **NEW**: `scripts/migrate.ts` - TypeScript migration runner
- **NEW**: `src/budget/hardGuard.ts` - production budget enforcement
- **NEW**: `src/migrations/runtimeRunner.ts` - background migration retry
- Refactored legacy migration scripts with TypeScript compatibility
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging throughout

### üöÄ Deployment & Infrastructure
- **FIXED**: Railway deployment crashes due to SSL certificate errors
- **FIXED**: Migration failures causing container crashes
- **IMPROVED**: Non-blocking prestart process with runtime fallback
- Added production environment detection and configuration
- Improved startup logging and system status reporting

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
- `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` no longer supported in production

### üîÑ Migration Guide
1. Remove insecure SSL environment variables from Railway
2. Ensure `DATABASE_URL` includes `?sslmode=require`
3. Set `DAILY_OPENAI_LIMIT_USD=5.00` for budget control
4. Verify `REAL_METRICS_ENABLED=false` in production
5. Test deployment with `POSTING_DISABLED=true` first
