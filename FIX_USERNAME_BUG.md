# 🔧 FIX CRITICAL USERNAME BUG

## **The Problem Found** 🐛

Your environment variable `TWITTER_USERNAME` is set to the **WRONG value** in Railway!

---

## **Evidence**

### **From Code** (`src/scrapers/bulletproofTwitterScraper.ts` line 850):
```typescript
const username = process.env.TWITTER_USERNAME || 'SignalAndSynapse';
const tweetUrl = `https://x.com/${username}/status/${tweetId}`;
```

### **From Logs:**
```
🔄 RELOAD: Navigating to https://x.com/Signal_Synapse/status/1979987035063771345
```

**The scraper is using `Signal_Synapse` which means:**

`process.env.TWITTER_USERNAME = "Signal_Synapse"` ❌

**Should be:**

`process.env.TWITTER_USERNAME = "SignalAndSynapse"` ✅

---

## **The Fix** 🔧

### **Step 1: Check Railway Environment Variable**

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Open your xBOT project
3. Go to **Variables** tab
4. Look for `TWITTER_USERNAME`

**Current value:** `Signal_Synapse` ❌
**Should be:** `SignalAndSynapse` ✅

### **Step 2: Update the Variable**

Change:
```
TWITTER_USERNAME=Signal_Synapse
```

To:
```
TWITTER_USERNAME=SignalAndSynapse
```

### **Step 3: Redeploy**

Railway will automatically redeploy with the new value.

---

## **Alternative: Remove the Variable Entirely**

Since the code has the correct default (`SignalAndSynapse`), you can also just **delete** the `TWITTER_USERNAME` environment variable entirely.

The code will then use the default:
```typescript
const username = process.env.TWITTER_USERNAME || 'SignalAndSynapse';
//                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//                                               This will be used
```

## **Why This Happened** 🤔

Likely scenarios:

2. **Old configuration** - Username was changed on Twitter but not in Railway
3. **Copy-paste error** - Copied wrong value into Railway variables

                                    WRONG!
```

### **After Fix:**
```bash
# Check Railway logs again
npm run logs | grep "Navigating to"
