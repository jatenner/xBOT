# üö® **POSTING SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS**

## **ISSUE DETECTED:**

‚ùå **Plan job is NOT running - no content being generated**

---

## **LOG EVIDENCE:**

### **1. Posting Queue - Empty:**
```
[POSTING_QUEUE] ‚ö†Ô∏è No queued content found in database at all
[POSTING_QUEUE] ‚úÖ Post budget available: 0/2 content posts
```

### **2. Plan Job - Missing from Logs:**
```
‚ùå NO [UNIFIED_PLAN] logs found
‚ùå NO content generation happening
‚ùå Queue remains empty
```

### **3. What IS Working:**
```
‚úÖ Posting job (runs every 5 min, finds nothing to post)
‚úÖ Reply job (found opportunity, generated reply to @drmarkhyman)
‚úÖ Metrics scraper (runs, but scraping old viral tweets)
```

---

## **ROOT CAUSE:**

**Plan job hasn't run since deployment.**

**Why:**
- Set `JOBS_PLAN_INTERVAL_MIN=720` (12 hours)
- Job scheduled to run every 12 hours
- But hasn't hit first scheduled time yet
- OR job didn't start on deployment

**Current state:**
```
numToGenerate = 1 post
Interval = 720 minutes (12 hours)
Result = 2 posts per day (correct config)
```

**Problem:** Job not running at all

---

## **SOLUTION:**

### **Option 1: Manual Trigger (Immediate)**
```bash
railway run node -e "require('./dist/jobs/planJobUnified').planContent()"
```
This will generate 1 post immediately

### **Option 2: Restart Service**
```bash
railway up --detach
```
Force job manager to re-register and start all jobs

### **Option 3: Lower Interval Temporarily**
```bash
railway variables --set JOBS_PLAN_INTERVAL_MIN=60
```
- Generates 1 post every hour
- Still only 2 posts/day (rate limit enforced by maxPostsPerHour)
- More reliable than 12-hour interval

---

## **RECOMMENDED FIX:**

**Immediate:** Manually trigger content generation once
**Long-term:** Use 60-minute interval with rate limiting (more reliable)

**Why 60min > 720min:**
- Jobs run more frequently (less chance of missing)
- Rate limiter prevents posting > 2/day
- If one cycle fails, next cycle catches up
- More resilient to deployment timing

---

## **SCRAPING ISSUES (Secondary):**

```
‚ö†Ô∏è VALIDATE: Likes (67837) exceeds reasonable threshold
‚ùå Failed to write outcomes: no unique constraint
```

**These are:** Scraping OTHER people's viral tweets (discovery for reply opportunities)
**Not affecting:** YOUR content posting
**Fix needed:** Raise like threshold or fix database constraint

---

**PRIORITY: Fix plan job not running (critical for posting)**
