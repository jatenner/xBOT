# üöÄ Reply System Overhaul - Deployment Status

## ‚úÖ DEPLOYED: Oct 28, 2024

---

## üì¶ **What Was Deployed**

### **Core Changes:**

1. **Tweet-Based Harvester** (NEW)
   - Searches Twitter directly for high-engagement tweets
   - 7 broad multi-angle search patterns
   - No dependency on account pool
   - Finds viral tweets from ANY account

2. **3-Tier Absolute Engagement System**
   - Platinum: 10,000+ likes OR 1,000+ comments
   - Diamond: 5,000+ likes OR 500+ comments
   - Golden: 2,000+ likes OR 200+ comments
   - Account size irrelevant

3. **Priority Sorting**
   - Replies prioritized by absolute likes (10K > 5K > 2K)
   - 10K+ like tweets replied to FIRST

4. **7 Broad Search Patterns** (instead of 90-topic rotation)
   - Mainstream: "health OR wellness OR fitness..."
   - Nutrition: "diet OR keto OR carnivore..."
   - Fitness: "workout OR gym OR exercise..."
   - Mental: "sleep OR anxiety OR stress..."
   - Science: "study OR research OR supplement..."
   - Trending: "ozempic OR seed oils..."
   - Plus: Twitter Explore

## üìä **Expected Results**

### **In 30 Minutes:**
```
First harvester cycle runs:
‚îú‚îÄ Executes 7 broad searches + Explore
‚îú‚îÄ Finds ~50-100 opportunities
‚îú‚îÄ Should include tweets with 5K-15K likes
‚îî‚îÄ Stores in reply_opportunities table

Check with:
SELECT like_count, reply_count, target_username 
FROM reply_opportunities 
ORDER BY like_count DESC 
LIMIT 10;

Expected top tweet: 8,000-15,000 likes
```

### **In 1 Hour:**
```
First reply cycle completes:
‚îú‚îÄ Picks top 4 opportunities (sorted by likes)
‚îú‚îÄ Should be: 10K, 9K, 8K, 7K likes (if Platinum found)
‚îú‚îÄ Generates AI replies
‚îî‚îÄ Posts to Twitter

Check posted_decisions for new replies
```

### **In 2 Hours:**
```
System fully operational:
‚îú‚îÄ Pool: 150-200 opportunities
‚îú‚îÄ Replies posted: ~8
‚îú‚îÄ Avg engagement: 5K-10K likes per replied tweet
‚îî‚îÄ Total reach: 400K-800K people
```

## üîç **MONITORING COMMANDS**

### **Check Opportunity Pool:**
```bash
node -e "require('dotenv').config(); const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js'); const s = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY); s.from('reply_opportunities').select('like_count, reply_count, target_username').order('like_count', {ascending: false}).limit(10).then(({data}) => {console.log('Top 10 opportunities by likes:'); data.forEach((o,i) => console.log(\`  \${i+1}. @\${o.target_username}: \${o.like_count} likes, \${o.reply_count} comments\`));});"
```

### **Check Recent Replies:**
```bash
node -e "require('dotenv').config(); const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js'); const s = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY); s.from('posted_decisions').select('posted_at, target_username, content').eq('decision_type', 'reply').gte('posted_at', new Date(Date.now() - 2*60*60*1000).toISOString()).order('posted_at', {ascending: false}).then(({data}) => {console.log('Replies in last 2 hours:', data.length); data.forEach((r,i) => {const minAgo = Math.floor((Date.now() - new Date(r.posted_at).getTime())/60000); console.log(\`  \${i+1}. \${minAgo}min ago to @\${r.target_username}\`);});});"
```

### **Check Railway Logs:**
```bash
railway logs | grep -E "TWEET_HARVESTER|REPLY_JOB"
```

Look for:
```
[TWEET_HARVESTER] üîç Executing 7 broad multi-angle searches...
[TWEET_HARVESTER] ‚úÖ Found X tweets with 2K+ likes
[REPLY_JOB] üí¨ Replying to tweet with 12000 likes
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Issues to Watch**

### **Issue 1: Authentication**
```
Log: "[TWEET_HARVESTER] ‚ùå Not authenticated"
Fix: Check TWITTER_SESSION_B64 is set in Railway
```

### **Issue 2: Search Returns No Results**
```
Log: "[TWEET_HARVESTER] Found 0 tweets"
Causes:
‚îú‚îÄ Twitter changed search URL format
‚îú‚îÄ Selectors changed
‚îî‚îÄ Rate limited

Check: Test searches manually on x.com
```

### **Issue 3: Engagement Not Extracting**
```
Log: "0 likes, 0 comments" for all tweets
Fix: Update selectors in searchTwitterForTweets()
```

### **Issue 4: Not Finding High-Engagement Tweets**
```
Pool has mostly <1K like tweets
Causes:
‚îú‚îÄ Twitter's "Top" sort not working
‚îú‚îÄ Health topics not as viral as expected
‚îî‚îÄ Search operators not working

Fix: Add Twitter advanced search operators
```

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA (2 Hours After Deploy)**

‚úÖ **System is working if:**
1. reply_opportunities has 100+ tweets
2. Top 10 opportunities have 2K-15K likes (not 16 likes!)
3. New replies posted in last hour
4. Replies are to tweets with 2K+ likes
5. No authentication errors in logs

‚ùå **System needs debugging if:**
1. Opportunity pool empty or <20 tweets
2. Top opportunities still have <500 likes
3. No replies posted in last 2 hours
4. Logs show authentication failures
5. Logs show "0 tweets found" from searches

---

## üìû **What to Report Back**

After 1-2 hours, run the monitoring commands above and report:

1. **Opportunity pool status:**
   - Total count
   - Top 5 by likes (should be 5K-15K range)

2. **Reply status:**
   - How many posted in last 2 hours
   - What engagement levels they targeted

3. **Any errors in Railway logs**

This will tell us if the new system is working as designed!
