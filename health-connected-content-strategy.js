      "The science: Blue light (480nm wavelength) suppresses melatonin production by 85% even at low intensities. Your brain thinks it's daytime at 11 PM. Result: Poor sleep, weight gain, depression, decreased immunity.",
      "Real solution stack: 1) f.lux on all devices (free), 2) Amber glasses after sunset ($20), 3) Blackout curtains ($30), 4) Red light bulbs for evening ($15). Total: $65 vs $1,200 iPhone that destroys your sleep."
