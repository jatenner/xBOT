# üéØ DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN - Exact Changes

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Status:** REVIEW ONLY (Not implemented yet)

---

## üìã OVERVIEW

**What We're Doing:**
1. **FIX #1:** Add "Accessible Expert" instructions to content generation (planJob.ts)
2. **FIX #2:** Simplify topic generation to use common terms (dynamicTopicGenerator.ts)

**Files Changed:** 2 files  
**Lines Changed:** ~10-15 total  
**Time Estimate:** 10 minutes  
**Risk Level:** Very Low (just adding AI instructions)

## üîß FIX #1: ADD "ACCESSIBLE EXPERT" TO PLANJOB.TS

### **FILE:** `src/jobs/planJob.ts`

### **LOCATION:** Lines 192-199 (inside `buildContentPrompt` function)

### **CURRENT CODE:**
```typescript
Create engaging health content that:
1. Explores the TOPIC from this specific ANGLE
2. Uses this exact TONE/voice
3. Stays within 260 characters
4. No first-person (I/me/my)
5. Avoid emojis (use 0-1 maximum, strongly prefer 0). Only use if genuinely adds clarity (data charts üìäüìâ, literal objects üßä). Never use decorative emojis (‚ú®üåüüí´üå±).

Be specific, interesting, and match the tone precisely. Let the content speak for itself without emoji decoration.
```

---

### **NEW CODE (What I'll Change It To):**
```typescript
Create engaging health content that:
1. Explores the TOPIC from this specific ANGLE
2. Uses this exact TONE/voice
3. Stays within 260 characters
4. No first-person (I/me/my)
5. Avoid emojis (use 0-1 maximum, strongly prefer 0). Only use if genuinely adds clarity (data charts üìäüìâ, literal objects üßä). Never use decorative emojis (‚ú®üåüüí´üå±).
6. Balance expert knowledge with clear communication:
   - Use technical terms when they add value (shows expertise)
   - Briefly explain what they mean in simple terms or parentheses
   - Include specific data, dosages, or mechanisms (builds credibility)
   - Keep sentences clear and direct (no unnecessary complexity)

Be specific, interesting, and match the tone precisely. Sound like an expert who communicates clearly to an intelligent audience.
```

---

### **WHAT THIS CHANGES:**

**Added:**
- New rule #6 with 4 sub-points about accessibility
- Updated closing line to emphasize "expert who communicates clearly"

**NOT Changed:**
- All existing rules (1-5) stay the same
- No removal of existing functionality
- Same character limits, emoji rules, etc.

### **IMPACT:**

**Before Fix:**
```
AI generates:
"Phosphatidylserine supplementation modulates HPA axis cortisol 
response via ACTH regulation."
```

**After Fix:**
```
AI generates:
"Phosphatidylserine (a brain supplement) reduces cortisol by 15-30%. 
Works by calming your stress response system. 300mg daily."
```

**Key Differences:**
- ‚úÖ Still uses "phosphatidylserine" (expert term)
- ‚úÖ Explains it ("brain supplement")
- ‚úÖ Includes specific data (15-30%, 300mg)
- ‚úÖ Explains mechanism ("stress response system")
- ‚úÖ Maintains authority while being clear

## üîß FIX #2: SIMPLIFY TOPIC GENERATION

### **FILE:** `src/intelligence/dynamicTopicGenerator.ts`

### **LOCATION:** Lines 162-249 (inside `buildTopicGenerationPrompt` method, specifically the system prompt)

### **CURRENT CODE (Line ~213-218):**
```typescript
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Be TRULY diverse WITHIN health!
- Don't default to sleep/circadian/psychedelics (explore ALL health domains!)
- Cover the ENTIRE spectrum: hormones, gut health, supplements, recovery, etc.
- Be specific: "BDNF" not "brain health", "HRV" not "heart health"
- Think: "What health topic does NO other account talk about?"
- Explore obscure but fascinating health topics
```

---

### **NEW CODE (What I'll Add):**

I'll add a NEW section right after line 218 (before "=== PERSPECTIVES ==="):

```typescript
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Be TRULY diverse WITHIN health!
- Don't default to sleep/circadian/psychedelics (explore ALL health domains!)
- Cover the ENTIRE spectrum: hormones, gut health, supplements, recovery, etc.
- Be specific: "BDNF" not "brain health", "HRV" not "heart health"
- Think: "What health topic does NO other account talk about?"
- Explore obscure but fascinating health topics

‚ö†Ô∏è ACCESSIBILITY: Use common, relatable language in topics:
- Prefer everyday terms over pure scientific jargon
- Think: "Cold Showers" not "Cryotherapy Protocol"
- Think: "Sleep Better" not "Circadian Rhythm Entrainment"
- Think: "Gut Health Reset" not "Microbiome Optimization"
- Think: "This Molecule Your Body Stops Making" not "NAD+ Precursor Supplementation"
- Still be specific and interesting, just more accessible
- You CAN use technical terms, but frame them relatably
- Example: "NAD+ (Your Cells' Energy Molecule)" ‚úÖ
- Example: "Phosphatidylserine: The Overlooked Hero" ‚ùå (no context)
```

=== PERSPECTIVES (Dimensions) ===
```

---

### **IMPACT:**

**Before Fix:**
```
AI generates topics like:
- "Phosphatidylserine: The Overlooked Hero of Stress Adaptation"
- "Optimizing NAD+ Precursors for Mitochondrial Biogenesis"
- "Fecal Microbiota Transplants (FMT): The Key to Metabolic Function"
```

**After Fix:**
```
AI generates topics like:
- "This Brain Supplement That Actually Reduces Stress"
- "The Anti-Aging Molecule Your Body Stops Making After 40"
- "How Gut Health Affects Your Metabolism (The Science)"
```

**Key Differences:**
- ‚úÖ More relatable phrasing
- ‚úÖ Uses common words as anchors
- ‚úÖ Can still mention technical terms but with context
- ‚úÖ More people understand what the topic is about

## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

### **Step 1: Update planJob.ts (5 minutes)**

1. Open `src/jobs/planJob.ts`
2. Navigate to line 192 (inside `buildContentPrompt` function)
3. Find the section that lists content rules (1-5)
4. Add new rule #6 with 4 sub-bullets (shown above)
5. Update the closing sentence to mention "expert who communicates clearly"
6. Save file

**Lines changed:** ~6-7 lines added

---

### **Step 2: Update dynamicTopicGenerator.ts (5 minutes)**

1. Open `src/intelligence/dynamicTopicGenerator.ts`
2. Navigate to line ~218 (after "Explore obscure but fascinating health topics")
3. Add new section: "‚ö†Ô∏è ACCESSIBILITY: Use common, relatable language in topics:"
4. Add the 9 bullet points with examples (shown above)
5. Save file

**Lines changed:** ~10 lines added

---

### **Step 3: Commit and Deploy (5 minutes)**

```bash
cd /Users/jonahtenner/Desktop/xBOT

# Stage changes
git add src/jobs/planJob.ts
git add src/intelligence/dynamicTopicGenerator.ts

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add accessible expert communication to content generation

- Add clarity guidelines to content prompts (maintain expertise)
- Simplify topic generation to use relatable language
- Balance technical terms with clear explanations
- Expected impact: 2x engagement from clearer communication"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# Deploy to Railway
railway up --detach
```

---

### **Step 4: Monitor Results (Ongoing)**

```bash
# Watch deployment
railway logs --tail 100

# Look for:
‚úÖ "DIVERSITY SYSTEM: Multi-Dimensional Content Generation"
‚úÖ "Generated single tweet (XXX chars)"
‚úÖ "Content queued in database"
‚úÖ No errors in content generation
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISK ANALYSIS

### **What Could Go Wrong:**

**Risk 1: AI Ignores Instructions**
- **Probability:** Low (AI usually follows explicit instructions)
- **Impact:** Medium (some posts still too technical)
- **Mitigation:** Monitor first 10-20 posts, adjust wording if needed

**Risk 2: Over-Simplification**
- **Probability:** Very Low (we're NOT saying "dumb it down")
- **Impact:** Low (would need to adjust wording)
- **Mitigation:** We're explicitly telling it to maintain expertise

**Risk 3: No Noticeable Change**
- **Probability:** Very Low (these are clear, direct instructions)
- **Impact:** Low (can iterate on prompts)
- **Mitigation:** Review generated content after 24 hours

**Risk 4: Deployment Issues**
- **Probability:** Very Low (we've deployed many times successfully)
- **Impact:** Medium (would delay implementation)
- **Mitigation:** Railway logs will show any build errors

## üéØ ROLLBACK PLAN (If Needed)

### **If Results Are Bad:**

**Option 1: Quick Revert (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Revert the commit
git revert HEAD

# Push revert
git push origin main

# Deploy revert
railway up --detach
```

**Option 2: Adjust Wording (10 minutes)**
```
- If too simple: Remove some accessibility instructions
- If still too technical: Add more emphasis on clarity
- Iterate based on results
```

**Option 3: Selective Fix (Keep One, Revert Other)**
```
- Keep Fix #2 (topics) if working well
- Revert Fix #1 (content) if over-simplified
- Or vice versa
```
