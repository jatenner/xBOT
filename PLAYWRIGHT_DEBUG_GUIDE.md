# 🔍 Playwright Railway Debugging Guide

## What We Just Deployed

Added **detailed step-by-step logging** to see exactly where Playwright fails on Railway.

## How to Monitor

Watch your Railway logs for the next posting attempt (~5 minutes):
```bash
npm run logs
```

## What to Look For

### ✅ Success Pattern:
```
📦 STEP 1: Launching Chromium with Railway config...
✅ STEP 1 COMPLETE: Browser launched, PID: connected
📦 STEP 2: Creating browser context...
✅ STEP 2 COMPLETE: Context created
📦 STEP 3: Loading Twitter session cookies...
✅ STEP 3 COMPLETE: Loaded 15 session cookies
📦 STEP 4: Creating new page...
✅ STEP 4 COMPLETE: Page created with extended timeouts
🎉 RAILWAY_POSTER: FULL INITIALIZATION SUCCESSFUL!
```

### ❌ Failure Patterns:

**If it fails at STEP 1:**
- Browser can't launch in Railway container
- Need to try different Chromium args
- Possible memory/CPU limits

**If it fails at STEP 2:**
- Context creation issue
- Viewport or settings problem

**If it fails at STEP 3:**
- Session cookie problem
- Twitter session expired
- Need to regenerate session

**If it fails at STEP 4:**
- Page creation timeout
- Network issues on Railway
- Browser disconnected prematurely

## Current Configuration

**Browser Args (Railway-optimized):**
- `--no-sandbox` - Container requirement
- `--single-process` - **CRITICAL** for Railway
- `--disable-dev-shm-usage` - Low memory handling
- `--disable-gpu` - No GPU in containers
- + 13 more optimization flags

**Timeouts:**
- Browser launch: 60 seconds
- Navigation: 60 seconds  
- Operations: 30 seconds

## Next Steps Based on Error

1. **Check logs in 3-5 minutes**
2. **Find which STEP failed**
3. **Apply targeted fix** based on failure point

## Quick Status Check (No Stalling)

```bash
cd /Users/jonahtenner/Desktop/xBOT
psql 'postgresql://postgres.qtgjmaelglghnlahqpbl:Christophernolanfan123!!@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?sslmode=require' -t -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM content_metadata WHERE status = 'posted' AND generated_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes';"
```

If count > 0: **SUCCESS! Posting is working!** 🎉
If count = 0: Check logs for which STEP failed
