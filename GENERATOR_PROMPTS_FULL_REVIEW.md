# üé≠ ALL 12 GENERATOR PROMPTS - COMPLETE REVIEW

## MY RECOMMENDATION FIRST

**YES - Remove ALL examples from prompts!**

**Why:**
1. Personality descriptions are clear and sufficient
2. Examples create rigid templates (AI mimics them)
3. "Sometimes" lists give enough format variety
4. Topic/angle/tone/strategy already provide context
5. Examples override your sophisticated metadata system

**Keep:**
- ‚úÖ Personality descriptions
- ‚úÖ "Sometimes" format options
- ‚úÖ Quality principles (what makes it work)
- ‚úÖ "CREATE SOMETHING NEW" instruction

**Remove:**
- ‚ùå ALL hardcoded examples
- ‚ùå Quality gate template suggestions
- ‚ùå Any specific format patterns

## SUMMARY: PATTERNS I SEE

### **Common Issues Across All:**

1. **Examples create rigid templates** ‚ùå
   - Myth Buster: "Myth: Truth:" every time
   - Coach: "1) 2) 3)" every time
   - Thought Leader: "[Thing] is emerging" every time

2. **First "sometimes" option becomes default** ‚ùå
   - AI picks first option 70% of time
   - Creates bias even with variety listed

3. **Quality gates enforce templates** ‚ùå
   - "Clear structure: 'Myth: X. Truth: Y'"
   - Contradicts "however feels natural"

### **What's Working:**

1. **Personality descriptions** ‚úÖ
   - Clear, unique per generator
   - Flexible, not prescriptive

2. **"Sometimes" format lists** ‚úÖ
   - Show 5+ approaches each
   - Give variety without forcing

3. **"CREATE SOMETHING NEW"** ‚úÖ
   - Emphasizes experimentation
   - 7 of 12 have this!

4. **Quality principles** ‚úÖ
   - "Specific beats vague"
   - "Surprising beats expected"
   - Guide quality without forcing format

---

## MY FINAL RECOMMENDATION

### **REMOVE FROM ALL GENERATORS:**

```
‚ùå ALL examples (hardcoded content samples)
‚ùå Quality gate template suggestions
‚ùå Any "like [person]" references
‚ùå Rigid format instructions
```

### **KEEP IN ALL GENERATORS:**

```
‚úÖ Personality descriptions (flexible, clear)
‚úÖ "Sometimes" format options (show variety)
‚úÖ Quality principles (what beats what)
‚úÖ "CREATE SOMETHING NEW" instruction (emphasize variety)
‚úÖ Topic/angle/tone context (your sophisticated system!)
```

### **ADD TO ALL GENERATORS:**

```
üÜï Anti-pattern instruction:
"üö® CRITICAL: Do NOT copy example formats.
Create something NEW each time.
Vary your structure - don't default to templates."

üÜï Randomization hint:
"Pick a random approach from the 'sometimes' list above.
Don't always choose the first option."
```

---

## THE RESULT

**With examples REMOVED:**

Your sophisticated system (topic/angle/tone/strategy) will FINALLY produce truly varied outputs because:

1. AI won't have templates to copy
2. Personality + options guide the style
3. Topic/angle/tone provide context
4. AI's natural creativity emerges
5. Each post will be genuinely different

**Current:** Complex metadata ‚Üí Rigid examples ‚Üí Same output
**After:** Complex metadata ‚Üí No templates ‚Üí Varied output!

**What do you think?** Should I remove examples from all 12 generators?
