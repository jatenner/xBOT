# ðŸš‚ Railway Container Resource Limits Guide

## How to Check Your Container's Resource Limits

### Method 1: Railway Dashboard (Most Accurate)

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. **Select your project**: "XBOT"
3. **Select your service**: "xBOT"
4. **Click "Settings" tab**
5. **Scroll to "Deploy" section** â†’ **"Resource Limits"**

You'll see sliders showing:
- **vCPU Limit** (e.g., 2 vCPU, 4 vCPU, 8 vCPU)
- **Memory Limit** (e.g., 2 GB, 4 GB, 8 GB, 16 GB)

### Method 2: Railway CLI

```bash
# Get service info
railway status

# Check environment variables (might show limits)
railway variables | grep -i "memory\|cpu"
```

### Method 3: From Within Running Container

We've added a new API endpoint that will show real-time resource usage:

```bash
# Once deployed, check:
curl https://xbot-production-844b.up.railway.app/api/resources
```

This will return:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "metrics": {
    "memory": {
      "total_gb": 8.0,
      "used_gb": 3.2,
      "free_gb": 4.8,
      "usage_percent": 40.0
    },
    "cpu": {
      "cores": 4,
      "load_avg": {
        "1min": 1.5,
        "5min": 1.2,
        "15min": 0.9
      }
    }
  },
  "health_status": "healthy",
  "recommendations": []
}
```

## Railway's Default Resource Limits (2024)

### Starter Plan ($5/month)
- **vCPU**: 2 shared cores
- **Memory**: 1 GB
- **Disk**: 1 GB ephemeral
- **Network**: Unlimited

### Pro Plan ($20/month base + usage)
- **vCPU**: Configurable (1-32 cores)
- **Memory**: Configurable (0.5 GB - 32 GB)
- **Disk**: Up to 50 GB persistent
- **Network**: Unlimited

### Resource Usage Pricing (Pro)
- **CPU**: $0.000463/vCPU minute
- **Memory**: $0.000231/GB minute

## How Railway Limits Work

1. **Soft Limits**: Your service can use UP TO the configured limit
2. **Container Restart**: If you exceed memory limit, container is killed (OOM)
3. **CPU Throttling**: If you exceed CPU, processes slow down (not killed)
4. **Automatic Scaling**: Railway doesn't auto-scale; you set fixed limits

## Recommended Limits for xBOT

Based on typical Playwright usage:

### Minimal Setup (Testing)
- **vCPU**: 2 cores
- **Memory**: 2 GB
- **Max Browsers**: 1 context

### Production Setup (Current)
- **vCPU**: 4 cores
- **Memory**: 4 GB
- **Max Browsers**: 2 concurrent contexts

### Heavy Load Setup
- **vCPU**: 8 cores
- **Memory**: 8 GB
- **Max Browsers**: 3-4 concurrent contexts

**Note**: Each Chromium instance uses ~200-500 MB RAM + 0.5-1 vCPU

## How to Adjust Limits

1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Service â†’ Settings â†’ Resource Limits
3. Adjust sliders:
   - Move **vCPU slider** to desired cores
   - Move **Memory slider** to desired GB
4. Click **Save**
5. Service will restart automatically

## Monitoring Your Usage

### Real-time Monitoring

```bash
# Watch resource endpoint every 5 seconds
watch -n 5 'curl -s https://xbot-production-844b.up.railway.app/api/resources | jq ".metrics"'
```

### Railway Metrics

Railway dashboard shows:
- **CPU usage** (%)
- **Memory usage** (MB/GB)
- **Network traffic** (inbound/outbound)
- **Build times**

Access at: Project â†’ Service â†’ **Metrics tab**

---

## Cost Estimation Tool

### Calculate Monthly Cost

**Formula**:
```
Monthly Cost = (vCPU Ã— $0.000463 + Memory_GB Ã— $0.000231) Ã— 60 Ã— 24 Ã— 30
```

**Example** (4 vCPU, 4 GB, running 24/7):
```
= (4 Ã— $0.000463 + 4 Ã— $0.000231) Ã— 60 Ã— 24 Ã— 30
= ($0.001852 + $0.000924) Ã— 43,200
= $0.002776 Ã— 43,200
= ~$120/month
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Target page, context or browser has been closed"
**Cause**: Browser contexts exceeding memory limit
**Fix**: Reduce `MAX_CONTEXTS` or upgrade memory limit

### "EAGAIN: Resource temporarily unavailable"
**Cause**: Process limit reached
**Fix**: Reduce concurrent operations or upgrade CPU limit

### Container keeps restarting
**Cause**: Memory limit exceeded (OOM kill)
**Fix**: Check logs for memory spike, upgrade memory limit

---

## Quick Checks

### Is your service hitting limits?

```bash
# Check recent errors
railway logs --lines 200 | grep -i "oom\|killed\|memory\|resource"

# Check container restarts
railway logs --lines 500 | grep -i "starting\|boot"
```

If you see frequent restarts within minutes, you're likely hitting limits.

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Check current limits in Railway dashboard
2. âœ… Deploy resource metrics endpoint (already added to code)
3. âœ… Monitor for 24 hours to see peak usage
4. âœ… Adjust limits based on actual usage patterns
5. âœ… Implement browser pool consolidation (UnifiedBrowserPool)
