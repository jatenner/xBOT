# DATABASE TABLE ANALYSIS CHECKLIST
*Systematic review of all tables for missing columns*

## ✅ COMPLETED TABLES
- [x] **tweet_analytics** - Fixed 16 missing columns (2025-08-06)
- [x] **bot_config** - Fixed column name issues (key/value structure confirmed)

## 🔍 TABLES TO ANALYZE
- [ ] **post_history** - Check for missing columns (referenced in error logs)
- [ ] **tweets** - Check for missing columns  
- [ ] **[OTHER TABLES]** - TBD based on table list query

## 🚨 KNOWN ISSUES FROM LOGS
From previous error messages, we expect to find:
- Missing `content_type` column in `post_history` table
- Potential `content.trim is not a function` issues (data type problems)
- Missing analytics/learning columns in various tables

## 📋 ANALYSIS PROCESS
1. Run schema query for each table
2. Compare against expected columns for that table's purpose
3. Create targeted migration for missing columns
4. Test migration in development
5. Deploy to production

## 🎯 GOAL
Create a comprehensive, accurate database schema that supports:
- Proper analytics storage
- AI learning systems
- Thread performance tracking
- Follower growth attribution
- A/B testing capabilities
