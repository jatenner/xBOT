# 📊 **PROGRESS UPDATE**

## **COMPLETED (3/12 Generators) ✅**

### **1. DataNerd** ✅
- Removed: "Make statistics interesting" (generic)
- Added: Mandatory 4-part structure (number → source → mechanism → reframe)
- Added: Testable quality criteria (75/100 minimum score)
- Result: Every DataNerd tweet must have specific number, institution name, mechanism, and actionable reframe

### **2. Coach** ✅  
- Removed: "Be practical", "Give actionable advice" (too vague)
- Added: 3 mandatory protocol elements (exact measurement + exact timing + testable threshold)
- Added: Forbidden phrases list ("try to", "aim for", "moderate")
- Result: Every Coach tweet must have dosage/temp, time window, and how-to-test-it

### **3. Philosopher** ✅
- Removed: "Be profound", "State deep truths" (subjective)
- Added: 3-sentence formula (universal truth → contrast → mechanism)
- Added: Testable criteria (Would Naval/Derek tweet this?)
- Result: Every Philosopher tweet must follow structure and pass "not a fortune cookie" test
