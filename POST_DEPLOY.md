# 🚀 Post-Deployment Steps

## ✅ Code Deployed to Railway!

Commit: `a551838d` - "Fix critical browser crashes"

Railway is now building and deploying your fixes...

---

## 📋 What to Do Next:

### Step 1: Monitor Deployment (2-3 minutes)

Watch Railway build:
```bash
npm run logs
```

**Wait for:**
- ✅ "Build completed successfully"
- ✅ "Starting application..."
- ✅ No more zygote crash errors

---

### Step 2: Clear Stuck Queue (After deployment completes)

Once Railway is running, clear the 10 stuck decisions:

**Option A - Using Railway CLI:**
```bash
railway login
railway link
railway run 'psql $DATABASE_URL -c "UPDATE content_metadata SET status='"'"'failed'"'"' WHERE status='"'"'queued'"'"' AND scheduled_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '"'"'1 hour'"'"';"'
```

**Option B - Using Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/[your-project]/sql
2. Run this query:
```sql
UPDATE content_metadata
SET status = 'failed'
WHERE status = 'queued'
  AND scheduled_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
  AND decision_id NOT IN (
    SELECT decision_id FROM posted_decisions
  );
```

---

### Step 3: Verify Posting Works (Within 5-10 minutes)

Watch the logs for successful posting:
```bash
npm run logs
```

**Look for:**
```
✅ Expected Success Logs:

[BROWSER_POOL] ✅ Browser initialized
[POSTING_QUEUE] 📮 Processing single: abc123...
[POSTING_QUEUE] ✅ Content posted via Playwright with ID: 1234567890
[POSTING_QUEUE] ✅ Posted 1/1 decisions
✅ JOB_POSTING: Completed successfully

[REPLY_JOB] 💬 Starting reply generation cycle...
[REPLY_BROWSER] ✅ Browser initialized
[REAL_ENGAGEMENT] ✅ Posted engagement to @username
```

**Should NOT see:**
```
❌ Old Errors (Should be gone):

[FATAL:zygote_host_impl_linux.cc(190)] Check failed...
Old Headless mode will be removed...
Target page, context or browser has been closed
```

---

### Step 4: Check Twitter

Visit: https://x.com/SignalAndSynapse

You should see:
- ✅ New tweets appearing (2 per hour)
- ✅ New replies appearing (4 per hour)
- ✅ Content from the last 9+ hours of queue

---

## 📊 Success Metrics:

| Metric | Before | After (Target) |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Posts/hour | 0 | 2 |
| Replies/hour | 0 | 4 |
| Browser crashes | Every attempt | 0 |
| Uptime | Failing | 100% |

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting:

### If posting still doesn't work:

1. **Check Playwright installation:**
```bash
railway run 'npx playwright install chromium --with-deps'
```

2. **Verify session exists:**
```bash
railway run 'printenv | grep TWITTER_SESSION_B64 | wc -c'
```
Should show > 100 (session is set)

3. **Check logs for other errors:**
```bash
npm run logs | grep -E "ERROR|FATAL|Failed"
```
