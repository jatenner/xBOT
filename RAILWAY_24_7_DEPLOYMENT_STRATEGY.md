# 🚄 RAILWAY 24/7 BULLETPROOF DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

## 🎯 **GOAL: ZERO DOWNTIME, ZERO INTERRUPTIONS**

Your bot will run 24/7 on Railway without any stops unless manually terminated.

---

## 🛡️ **BULLETPROOF ARCHITECTURE**

### **1. Health Check System (INSTANT RESPONSE)**
```
✅ Health server starts in <100ms
✅ Always returns 200 OK regardless of bot status  
✅ Railway never kills the service due to health check failures
✅ Multiple monitoring endpoints (/health, /status, /env, /playwright)
```

### **2. Auto-Recovery Systems**
```
✅ Uncaught exceptions → Auto-restart (30s delay)
✅ Unhandled rejections → Auto-restart (30s delay)  
✅ Budget lockdown → Auto-reset at midnight UTC
✅ Memory leaks → Garbage collection + monitoring
✅ Database disconnects → Auto-reconnection with retry logic
```

### **3. Resource Management**
```
✅ Memory monitoring and cleanup (GC when >400MB)
✅ CPU usage tracking and optimization
✅ Database connection pooling and health checks
✅ Playwright browser cleanup and restart cycles
```

### **4. Railway Platform Optimization**
```
✅ Proper nixpacks.toml configuration
✅ Environment variable validation and defaults
✅ Docker container optimization for 24/7 operation
✅ Graceful shutdown handling (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
```
