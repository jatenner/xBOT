# Railway Deployment Fix - October 15, 2025

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Migration Blocking Startup**
- The `prestart` hook in package.json was running migrations **before** the app started
- This caused the health check endpoint to be unavailable during migration
- Railway health checks failed because `/status` endpoint wasn't responding

### 2. **Database Connection Delays**
- Migrations could timeout (3 second limit)
- Connection issues would block entire application startup
- No graceful degradation if migrations failed

### 3. **Build Configuration Inconsistencies**
- Railway.json was using NIXPACKS builder
- Dockerfile existed but wasn't being used
- Start command inconsistencies between Docker and npm

### 4. **Health Check Timing**
- 600 second timeout was too long
- Server wasn't starting fast enough to pass initial checks
- No background task management

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Removed Prestart Hook** ✅
**File:** `package.json`
```json
// REMOVED: "prestart": "node -r dotenv/config scripts/migrate-bulletproof.js dotenv_config_path=.env"
// Simplified start command
"start": "node dist/src/main-bulletproof.js"
```

**Benefit:** Server starts immediately without waiting for migrations

### 2. **Background Migration Execution** ✅
**File:** `src/main-bulletproof.ts`
- Added `runBackgroundMigrations()` function
- Migrations run AFTER health server is up
- Non-blocking, fire-and-forget approach
- Logs completion status without blocking startup

```typescript
async function boot() {
  // START SERVER FIRST
  await startServer();
  
  // THEN run background tasks
  runBackgroundMigrations();
  // ... other background tasks
}
```

**Benefit:** Health checks pass immediately while migrations run in background

### 3. **Updated Railway Configuration** ✅
**File:** `railway.json`
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE"  // Changed from NIXPACKS
  },
  "deploy": {
    "healthcheckTimeout": 300,  // Reduced from 600
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 5  // Reduced from 10
  }
}
```

**Benefit:** More reliable Docker builds, faster health checks

### 4. **Enhanced Dockerfile** ✅
**File:** `Dockerfile`
- Added scripts directory for migrations
- More lenient health check timing (60s start period)
- Dynamic PORT environment variable support
- Proper error handling for missing files

```dockerfile
# Copy scripts for migrations
COPY scripts ./scripts

# Health check - more lenient
HEALTHCHECK --start-period=60s --timeout=10s
```

**Benefit:** Container has everything needed for background migrations

### 5. **Startup Sequence Optimization** ✅
**New Order:**
1. ✅ Load configuration (instant)
2. ✅ Start health server (instant)
3. ✅ Health checks pass immediately
4. ✅ Run migrations in background (non-blocking)
5. ✅ Start job manager (non-blocking)
6. ✅ Load predictor models (non-blocking)
7. ✅ Run startup gates (non-blocking)

**Benefit:** Fast startup, all health checks pass

## Migration Strategy

### Before (Blocking):
```
Build → Install → Prestart Migration → Start → Health Check
                  ↑ BLOCKS HERE
```

### After (Non-Blocking):
```
Build → Install → Start → Health Check ✅
                        ↓
                   Background Migration
```

## Testing Locally

### 1. Build Test
```bash
npm run build
# Should complete successfully
```

### 2. Start Test
```bash
npm start
# Should see:
# ✅ Health server listening on 0.0.0.0:8080
# 📊 Status endpoint: http://0.0.0.0:8080/status
# ✅ HEALTH_SERVER: Server is ready, starting background tasks...
```

### 3. Health Check Test
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/status
# Should return 200 OK immediately
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. **Commit Changes**
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: Railway deployment - health checks, background migrations"
git push origin main
```

### 2. **Railway Auto-Deploy**
Railway will automatically:
1. Detect changes
2. Build using Dockerfile
3. Start application
4. Health checks should pass within 60 seconds

### 3. **Monitor Deployment**
Watch Railway logs for:
- ✅ Health server startup
- 🗄️ Background migrations starting
- 🗄️ Migrations completing
- ✅ All services operational

## Expected Log Sequence

```
🔄 XBOT_BOOT: Starting bulletproof production runtime...
🚀 XBOT_STARTUP_SUMMARY: ...
✅ Using runtime entry: ./server.start()
🏥 Health server listening on 0.0.0.0:8080
📊 Status endpoint: http://0.0.0.0:8080/status
✅ HEALTH_SERVER: Server is ready, starting background tasks...
🗄️ MIGRATIONS: Starting background migrations...
[MIGRATE] 🚀 Starting non-blocking migrations...
[MIGRATE] ✅ Schema tracking table ready
💓 HEARTBEAT: ...
```

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:

### Option 1: Revert to Previous Deploy
```bash
# In Railway dashboard
Settings → Deployments → Select previous successful deployment → Rollback
```

### Option 2: Revert Code
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Emergency Fix
If migrations are causing issues:
```bash
# Temporarily disable migrations
# Edit scripts/migrate-bulletproof.js and add at top:
console.log('Migrations temporarily disabled');
process.exit(0);
```

## Database Migration Notes

### Migration Behavior:
- ✅ Runs in background (non-blocking)
- ✅ 3 second timeout per migration
- ✅ Skips already-applied migrations
- ✅ Handles idempotent errors gracefully
- ✅ Logs all activity
- ✅ Never blocks application startup

### Migration Tracking:
All migrations are tracked in `public.schema_migrations` table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM public.schema_migrations ORDER BY applied_at DESC;
```

### Manual Migration (if needed):
```bash
# SSH into Railway container
railway run bash

# Run migrations manually
node scripts/migrate-bulletproof.js
```

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in Railway:

### Required:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Supabase connection string
- `PORT` - Set by Railway automatically
- `NODE_ENV` - Should be "production"

### Optional but Recommended:
- `POSTING_DISABLED` - Set to "true" for initial deploy test
- `DRY_RUN` - Set to "true" for testing
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Set to "info" or "debug"

## Success Criteria

✅ Build completes in < 60 seconds
✅ Health checks pass within 60 seconds  
✅ `/status` endpoint returns 200 OK
✅ Migrations complete in background
✅ No restart loops
✅ Logs show "HEARTBEAT" every 60 seconds

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Health checks still failing
**Solution:** Check Railway logs for actual error
```bash
railway logs --service xBOT | tail -100
```

### Issue: Migrations fail
**Solution:** Migrations are non-blocking, app will still work
- Check logs: `[MIGRATE]` prefix
- Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
- Run migrations manually if needed

### Issue: Build fails
**Solution:** Check TypeScript compilation
```bash
npm run build
# Fix any TypeScript errors
```

### Issue: Port binding error
**Solution:** Ensure PORT environment variable is being read
- Railway sets PORT automatically
- App uses `process.env.PORT` (default 8080)

## Post-Deployment Verification

1. **Check Health Endpoint**
```bash
curl https://xbot-production-844b.up.railway.app/status
```

2. **Check Logs**
```bash
railway logs --service xBOT
```

3. **Verify Database Connection**
```bash
curl https://xbot-production-844b.up.railway.app/env
# Should show database connection info (safe, no credentials)
```

4. **Test Posting (if enabled)**
```bash
curl https://xbot-production-844b.up.railway.app/post \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Test post"}'
```

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `package.json` - Removed prestart, simplified start
2. ✅ `src/main-bulletproof.ts` - Background migrations, optimized boot sequence
3. ✅ `railway.json` - Changed to Dockerfile builder, adjusted timeouts
4. ✅ `Dockerfile` - Added scripts directory, improved health checks

## Files to Delete (Optional Cleanup)

- `Procfile` - Not needed with Railway
- `fix-generation-metadata-now.sql` - Untracked migration file
