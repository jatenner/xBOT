# 🔍 **REPLY SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS**

## **THE PROBLEM:**

```
✅ Reply enabled in feature flags
✅ Reply job scheduled (every 60 min)
✅ 5 accounts discovered
❌ 0 replies ever posted
❌ Reply opportunities: UNKNOWN (need to check logs)
```

---

## **ROOT CAUSE (Most Likely):**

The reply system depends on a **complex chain**:

```
1. Account Discovery
   ↓
2. Tweet Scraping (from those accounts)
   ↓
3. Opportunity Finding (recent tweets)
   ↓
4. Reply Generation
   ↓
5. Reply Posting
```

**If ANY link breaks, no replies happen.**

---

## **LIKELY ISSUES:**

### **Issue 1: No Fresh Tweets Discovered**

The system has 5 accounts but may have **0 recent tweets** from them.

**Why?**
- Account discovery ran once
- Tweet scraping job not running
- Or tweets are too old (> 24hrs)

**Fix:** Ensure tweet discovery runs regularly

---

### **Issue 2: Opportunity Finding Returns 0**

Even if tweets exist, `findReplyOpportunities()` might return empty.

**Why?**
- Tweets too old (not in "early" reply window)
- Followers too low/high (not in 10K-100K range)
- Already replied to these accounts
- Tweets not in health niche

**Fix:** Lower opportunity thresholds

---

### **Issue 3: LLM Budget Blocked**

Reply generation might be blocked by budget limits.

**Why?**
- Daily API limit reached
- Emergency lockdown triggered
- Budget cap hit

**Fix:** Check LLM budget status

---

### **Issue 4: Posting Failed Silently**

Replies generated but posting failed.

**Why?**
- Browser session expired
- Twitter rate limits
- Playwright errors swallowed

**Fix:** Check posting logs

---

## **DIAGNOSTIC COMMANDS:**

```bash
# Check if tweet_metrics has recent tweets
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tweet_metrics WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

# Check if opportunity finder is working
# (Need to check logs for "Found X opportunities")

# Check LLM budget
# (Need to check budget file or logs)

# Check reply job execution
# (Check logs for "REPLY_JOB")
```

---

## **QUICK FIX OPTIONS:**

### **Option 1: Force Reply Discovery**
Manually trigger tweet discovery for known accounts.

### **Option 2: Lower Opportunity Thresholds**
Make system less picky about reply targets.

### **Option 3: Add Debug Logging**
Add explicit logging at each step to find where it breaks.

**Need to check logs and data to determine exact failure point.**
