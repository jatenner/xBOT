Here's what I eat instead:
• Skip breakfast entirely (16:8 fasting)
• Black coffee with MCT oil
• First meal at noon: eggs + avocado + spinach
• No grains, no sugar, no seed oils

My energy levels went through the roof.

Try it for 7 days and thank me later. 🔥`,

1. "Eat less, move more" for weight loss

2. "Cholesterol causes heart disease" 
   → Actually: sugar and inflammation are the real culprits

3. "You need 8 glasses of water daily"
   → Actually: drink when thirsty, quality > quantity

4. "Low-fat diets are healthy"
   → Actually: your brain is 60% fat and needs quality fats

5. "Breakfast is the most important meal"
   → Actually: fasting 16+ hours optimizes metabolism

Which one shocked you most? 👇`,

❌ Whole grain bread (gluten = gut inflammation)
❌ Vegetable oil (omega-6 overload)

❌ Quinoa (antinutrients)
❌ Almonds (high oxalates)

Replaced with:
✅ Grass-fed beef
✅ Wild-caught salmon
✅ Organic eggs
✅ Avocados
✅ Leafy greens

My joint pain disappeared completely.
