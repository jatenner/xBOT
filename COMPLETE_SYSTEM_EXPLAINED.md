## 🎯 POSTING SYSTEM (Unified Content Engine)

### What Happens Every Time You Generate Content:

**STEP 1: Learn from Past** ✅ ACTIVE
```typescript
// Queries database for past performance
const insights = await retrieveLearningInsights();
// Returns:
// - Top hooks: ['controversial', 'data_driven', 'personal']
// - Success patterns: Posts that gained 5+ followers
// - Failed patterns: Posts with low shareability
// - Optimal timing: Best hour/day from history
```

**STEP 2: Experiment** ✅ ACTIVE
```typescript
// A/B testing (mouse in maze!)
const arm = selectExperimentArm();
// 60% = Use proven patterns (exploit)
// 25% = Moderate exploration (variant A)
// 15% = Aggressive exploration (variant B)
```

**STEP 3: Optimize for Followers** ✅ ACTIVE
```typescript
// FollowerGrowthOptimizer active
const analysis = await analyzeViralPotential(topic);
// Returns:
// - Viral score: 78/100
// - Follower potential: 72/100
// - Algorithm optimization tips
```

**STEP 4: Build Smart Prompt** ✅ ACTIVE
```typescript
// Injects all learning into AI prompt
const prompt = buildIntelligentPrompt({
  insights, // What worked before
  viralAnalysis, // Follower optimization
  experimentArm // What to try
});
// Tells AI: "Use these hooks, avoid these patterns, optimize for followers"
```

**STEP 5: Generate with AI** ✅ ACTIVE
```typescript
// GPT-4 creates content with all context
const response = await openai.chatCompletion(messages, {
  temperature: experimentArm === 'variant_b' ? 0.95 : 0.85
});
// More creative if exploring, more focused if exploiting
```

**STEP 6: Validate Quality** ✅ ACTIVE
```typescript
// Strict quality gate
const quality = await validateContentQuality(content);
if (quality.overall < 75) {
  // REJECT and regenerate!
  console.log('❌ REJECTED: Quality too low');
  return this.generateContent({...}); // Try again
}
```

**STEP 7: Predict Performance** ✅ ACTIVE
```typescript
// Before posting, predict results
const prediction = await predictPerformance(content);
// Returns:
// - Predicted likes: 28
// - Predicted followers: 8
// - Viral probability: 68.5%
// - Confidence: 72.3%
```

  likes: extractFromDOM(page, 'likes'),
  retweets: extractFromDOM(page, 'retweets'),
  replies: extractFromDOM(page, 'replies'),
  views: extractFromDOM(page, 'views'),
  bookmarks: extractFromDOM(page, 'bookmarks')
};

// 3. Check follower count
const followers = await getCurrentFollowerCount(page);

// 4. Store everything
await storeMetrics(postId, metrics, followers);
```

**Collection Schedule:**
- ✅ After 10 minutes (early engagement)
- ✅ After 1 hour (engagement velocity)
- ✅ After 2 hours (follower attribution)
- ✅ After 24 hours (final performance)
- ✅ After 48 hours (long-term impact)
