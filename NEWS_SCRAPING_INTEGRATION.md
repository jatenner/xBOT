# üóûÔ∏è TWITTER NEWS SCRAPING SYSTEM - INTEGRATION COMPLETE

## ‚úÖ WHAT WAS BUILT

A comprehensive real-time news scraping system that integrates seamlessly with your existing xBOT architecture.

---

## üìä SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### **3 Core Components:**

1. **News Scraper** (`src/news/newsScraperJob.ts`)
   - Scrapes Twitter every hour
   - Sources: CNN, Fox News, NYT, WebMD, health influencers
   - Stores raw tweets with timestamps

2. **News Curator** (`src/news/newsCuratorService.ts`)
   - AI analyzes scraped tweets
   - Extracts topics, claims, credibility
   - Filters and ranks news

3. **Trending Tracker** (`src/news/trendingTopicsService.ts`)
   - Detects trending topics in real-time
   - Compares today vs. yesterday mentions
   - Flags viral content

---

## üîÑ HOW IT INTEGRATES

### **Existing System Flow (UNCHANGED):**
```
Every 3 hours:
1. Plan Job runs
2. Exploration Wrapper generates topic
3. Content Orchestrator selects generator
4. Generator creates content
5. Quality check + viral scoring
6. Store in database
7. Post via queue
```

### **NEW Integration Points:**

#### **Point 1: News Reporter Generator**
```typescript
// OLD: Made up fake studies
generateNewsReporterContent(topic) {
  "MIT 2024 study shows..." // ‚Üê FAKE
}

// NEW: Uses real scraped news
generateNewsReporterContent(topic) {
  const realNews = await getRealNewsForTopic(topic);
  // Uses actual CNN/Fox/health outlet tweets
  // References real viral content
  // Includes actual study URLs
}
```

#### **Point 2: Dynamic Topic Generation**
```typescript
// NEW: Check trending topics first
const trendingTopics = await getTrendingTopics();
// "cold exposure" is trending 5.2x today

// Generate content about what's ACTUALLY viral
topic = trendingTopics[0]; // cold exposure
```

#### **Point 3: Content Orchestrator**
```typescript
// NEW: Can query curated news
const news = await getCuratedNews({
  topic: 'sleep',
  minFreshnessScore: 60,
  unused: true
});

// Use real news as research foundation
```
