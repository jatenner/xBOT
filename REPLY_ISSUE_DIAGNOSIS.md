# üö® REPLY SYSTEM ISSUE - Not Running

## What I Found in Logs

‚úÖ Content generation: WORKING
‚úÖ Metrics scraping: WORKING  
‚úÖ Account discovery: WORKING
‚ùå Reply jobs: **NO LOGS AT ALL**

Expected to see:
- `[REPLY_JOB]` messages
- `[HARVESTER]` messages
- `reply_posting` execution logs
- `reply_harvester` execution logs

**Saw: NOTHING**

## The Code Shows Jobs ARE Scheduled

Lines 281-306 in jobManager.ts:
```typescript
this.scheduleStaggeredJob('reply_harvester', ...)  // Every 30 min, start after 10 min
this.scheduleStaggeredJob('reply_posting', ...)     // Every 15 min, start after 2 min
```

But they're not appearing in logs = they're not executing.

---

## Possible Causes

1. **Staggered scheduling might not include these jobs**
2. **There might be a condition blocking them**
3. **Jobs might be silently failing**

Let me investigate...
