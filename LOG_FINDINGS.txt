🎉 BREAKTHROUGH #1: REGULAR TWEETS ARE POSTING! ✅

Evidence from logs:
  ✅ "ULTIMATE_POSTER: ✅ Post button clicked successfully"
  ✅ "ULTIMATE_POSTER: ✅ UI verification successful"
  ✅ "ULTIMATE_POSTER: ✅ Real verification successful - tweet ID: 1981795128348975174"
  ✅ "Posted: https://x.com/Signal_Synapse/status/1981795128348975174"

Tweet details:
  • ID: 1981795128348975174
  • Time: ~2:50 PM
  • Content: "Caloric restriction is often touted..."
  • Status: SUCCESSFULLY POSTED ✅

Your enhanced logging worked! We can now see:
  - Post button found: [data-testid="tweetButtonInline"]
  - Normal click succeeded
  - UI verification passed
  - Tweet extracted from profile

❌ PROBLEM #1: REPLIES STILL FAILING

All 5 strategies failing with:
  ❌ "COMPOSER_NOT_FOUND: Tried all selectors"
  ❌ "Waiting for composer to render..." → [3s wait] → "COMPOSER_NOT_FOUND"

Pattern in logs:
  1. ✅ "Found first action button (reply)"
  2. ✅ Click reply button
  3. ⏰ "Waiting for composer to render..." 
  4. ❌ "COMPOSER_NOT_FOUND"
  5. ❌ Try next strategy... repeat

This happens for ALL strategies:
  - visual_position
  - keyboard_shortcut
  - icon_detection  
  - mobile_interface
  - legacy_selectors

Root cause: Composer takes >3 seconds to appear OR modal is blocked

🚨 PROBLEM #2: RAILWAY ENV VARS NOT SET!

Evidence from logs:
  [REPLY_DIAGNOSTIC] 📊 QUOTA STATUS:
    • Daily: 0/72 (72 available)      ← Should be /100!
    • Time since last: required: 20 min ← Should be 15!

The system is using DEFAULT values:
  ❌ REPLY_MINUTES_BETWEEN=20 (default) - should be 15
  ❌ REPLY_MAX_PER_DAY=72 (default) - should be 100
  ✅ REPLIES_PER_HOUR=4 (correct)
  ✅ REPLY_BATCH_SIZE=1 (correct)

---

✅ SUCCESS #1: REPLY RATE LIMITING SYSTEM WORKS!

Diagnostic logs are beautiful:
  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  [REPLY_DIAGNOSTIC] 🔄 CYCLE #3 START
  [REPLY_DIAGNOSTIC] ⏰ 10/24/2025, 2:46:44 PM
  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  [REPLY_DIAGNOSTIC] 📊 QUOTA STATUS:
    • Hourly: 0/4 (4 available)
    • Daily: 0/72 (72 available)
    • Time since last: 1169 min (required: 20 min) ✅
  [REPLY_JOB] 🎯 All rate limits passed - proceeding with generation
  ...
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  [REPLY_DIAGNOSTIC] ✅ CYCLE #3 SUCCESS
  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Perfect! Just need to set Railway env vars to get 15min/100day targets.

✅ SUCCESS #2: REPLY GENERATION WORKING!

  [REPLY_JOB] ✅ Found 10 reply opportunities from database pool
  [REPLY_JOB] 🎯 Generating 1 replies (batch size: 1)
  [STRATEGIC_REPLY] ✅ Generated reply (220 chars)
  [REPLY_JOB] ✅ Reply queued (#1/1)
  [REPLY_JOB] 📋 Reply Queue Status:
    • Queued for posting: 116 replies  ← WOW! Big queue!

Reply system is:
  ✅ Finding opportunities
  ✅ Generating content
  ✅ Queuing for posting
  ❌ But failing to actually POST (composer issue)

---

✅ SUCCESS #3: OTHER SYSTEMS HEALTHY

Account Discovery:
  ✅ Found 18 accounts via hashtags
  ✅ Pool size: 379 accounts
  ✅ "Account pool healthy"

Reply Harvesting:
  ✅ Harvested 27 new opportunities

🔧 FIXES NEEDED

URGENT:
  1. Add Railway env vars (2 min)
     - REPLY_MINUTES_BETWEEN=15
     - REPLY_MAX_PER_DAY=100
     
  2. Fix reply composer wait time (5 min)
     - Increase from 3s to 5-6s
     - Or add modal detection first
     
MEDIUM:
  3. Clear stuck reply queue (116 replies queued!)
     - Most will be stale now
     - Need to clear old ones
