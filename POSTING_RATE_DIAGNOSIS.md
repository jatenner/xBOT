# 📊 POSTING RATE DIAGNOSIS - Not Hitting Target

**Date:** October 26, 2025, 4:30 PM  
**Status:** POSTING BELOW TARGET

---

## 📊 THE NUMBERS

### **Expected:**
```
Config: MAX_POSTS_PER_HOUR = 2
Expected: 2 posts/hour × 24 hours = 48 posts/day
```

### **Actual (Last 7 Days):**
```
Oct 26: 15 posts
Oct 25: 14 posts
Oct 24: 14 posts
Oct 23: 8 posts
Oct 22: 5 posts
Oct 21: 36 posts ✅ (close to target!)
Oct 20: 5 posts

Average: 13.9 posts/day
Target: 48 posts/day

= Only posting 29% of target rate!
```

---

## 🔍 WHY ONLY ~14 POSTS/DAY?

### **Likely Issues:**

**1. Quality Gate Blocking Content**
```
With MIN_QUALITY_SCORE = 0.50:
- Content generated: X attempts
- Content passing quality: ~30%?
- Content posted: 14/day

If quality gate rejects 70%, you'd need:
- 48 attempts to get 14 posts (at 30% pass rate)
```

**2. Plan Job Not Running Every 30 Min**
```
Config: JOBS_PLAN_INTERVAL_MIN = 30 (every 30 min)
Expected: 48 generations/day
Actual: May not be running consistently

Check: Is plan job actually running 48x/day?
```

**3. Generation Failures**
```
Looking at status:
- Singles failed: 111/230 = 48% failure rate
- Singles posted: 97/230 = 42% success rate

Nearly HALF of attempts are failing!
```

## 🎯 FOR THREADS

### **User's Goal:**
> "2-3 threads out of 40 posts/day"

**Math:**
```
2-3 threads / 40 posts = 5-7.5%
NOT 30%!

So thread generation should be:
- 5-7% chance (not 30%)
- OR 2-3 threads guaranteed per day
```

### **Current 30% Logic Won't Work:**
```
If 30% of 40 posts = 12 threads/day
User wants: 2-3 threads/day

= Need 5-7% thread chance, not 30%!
```

---

## 🔧 TWO SEPARATE ISSUES

### **Issue #1: Only 14 Posts/Day (Should Be 48)**

**Why:**
- Quality gate too strict? (50% still rejecting 70%?)
- Plan job not running 48x/day?
- High failure rate (48%)?
- Budget limits?

**Impact:**
- Missing 34 posts/day
- Missing 238 posts/week
- Slow follower growth

### **Issue #2: 0 Threads (Should Be 2-3/Day)**

**Why:**
- Prompt doesn't ask for threads
- No thread generation logic

**Impact:**
- Missing 2-3 threads/day
- Missing 14-21 threads/week
- Missing best engagement format

## 📋 WHAT TO CHECK

1. **Why only 14 posts/day instead of 48?**
   - Check plan job frequency
   - Check quality gate rejection rate
   - Check failure reasons
   - Check budget limits

2. **For threads: Use 5-7% not 30%**
   - 2-3 threads out of 40 posts = 5-7%
   - Or guarantee 2-3 threads/day regardless of percentage
