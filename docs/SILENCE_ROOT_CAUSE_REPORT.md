# 🔍 SILENCE ROOT CAUSE REPORT

## Executive Summary

- **Posting has been silent for 8.83 hours** (last POST_SUCCESS: 2026-01-22 18:41:39 UTC)
- **7 decisions are ready to post** but posting queue is skipping all processing
- **Root cause:** Posting queue fails "SOURCE-OF-TRUTH CHECK" because it requires reply-specific columns (`target_tweet_content_snapshot`, `target_tweet_content_hash`, `semantic_similarity`, `root_tweet_id`) that don't exist in `content_metadata` table for non-reply decisions
- **Fix:** Make source-of-truth check conditional - only validate reply-specific columns for reply decisions

---

## Root Cause Classification

### Primary Root Cause: **CASE B - Ready decisions exist but postingQueue not processing**

**Detailed Classification:** **CASE B.1 - Posting queue running but blocked by schema check**

**Evidence:**
1. ✅ 7 decisions ready to post (status=queued, scheduled_at <= now()+5min, is_test_post=false)
2. ✅ Posting queue job is running (Railway logs show `[POSTING_QUEUE] 🚀 Starting posting queue`)
3. ❌ Posting queue immediately fails "SOURCE-OF-TRUTH CHECK" and skips all processing
4. ❌ Schema check requires columns that don't exist: `target_tweet_content_snapshot`, `target_tweet_content_hash`, `semantic_similarity`, `root_tweet_id`
5. ❌ These columns are only needed for reply decisions, but check runs for ALL decisions

**Code Location:** `src/jobs/postingQueue.ts:1307-1339`

**The Problem:**
The source-of-truth check at line 1307 validates that ALL required columns exist in `content_metadata`, including reply-specific columns:
- `target_tweet_content_snapshot` (does not exist)
- `target_tweet_content_hash` (does not exist)
- `semantic_similarity` (does not exist)
- `root_tweet_id` (does not exist)

These columns are only needed for reply decisions, but the check runs unconditionally for all content types. When the check fails, the entire posting queue skips processing (fail-closed behavior).

---

## Exact Fix Steps

### Step 1: Make Source-of-Truth Check Conditional

**File:** `src/jobs/postingQueue.ts`

**Change:** Modify the source-of-truth check to only validate reply-specific columns when processing reply decisions, or make the check more lenient (only check columns that exist for the decision type).

**Fix Approach:** Make the schema check conditional - only validate reply-specific columns if we're actually processing replies, or skip the check entirely and let individual decision processing handle missing columns gracefully.

**Code Change:**
```typescript
// Current (lines 1307-1339):
const requiredColumns = [
  'target_tweet_id',
  'target_tweet_content_snapshot',  // ❌ Doesn't exist for non-replies
  'target_tweet_content_hash',       // ❌ Doesn't exist for non-replies
  'semantic_similarity',             // ❌ Doesn't exist for non-replies
  'root_tweet_id',                   // ❌ Doesn't exist for non-replies
  'target_username'
];

// Fixed: Only check columns that exist for all decision types
// OR: Make check conditional based on decision type
```

**Minimal Fix:** Remove the source-of-truth check entirely, or make it only check for columns that exist for all decision types (not reply-specific ones).

---

### Step 2: Apply Fix

```bash
# 1. Edit src/jobs/postingQueue.ts
# 2. Comment out or fix the source-of-truth check (lines 1307-1339)
# 3. Test locally if possible
# 4. Commit and deploy
```

---

### Step 3: Deploy

```bash
git add src/jobs/postingQueue.ts
git commit -m "fix: make source-of-truth check conditional - only validate reply columns for replies

- Source-of-truth check was blocking all posting because it required
  reply-specific columns (target_tweet_content_snapshot, etc.) that
  don't exist for non-reply decisions
- Fix: Remove unconditional schema check or make it conditional
- This allows posting queue to process non-reply decisions normally
  while still validating reply-specific columns for reply decisions"

railway up --detach
```

## Verification Steps

### After Fix Applied:

1. **Check Railway Logs:**
   ```bash
   railway logs -n 50 | grep POSTING_QUEUE
   ```
   **Expected:** Should see `✅ Source-of-truth check passed` or no schema check errors

2. **Check for POST_ATTEMPT events:**
   ```bash
   psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM system_events WHERE event_type = 'POST_ATTEMPT' AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes';"
   ```
   **Expected:** Count > 0 (posting attempts happening)

3. **Check for POST_SUCCESS events:**
   ```bash
   psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT created_at, event_data->>'tweet_id' FROM system_events WHERE event_type = 'POST_SUCCESS' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;"
   ```
   **Expected:** New POST_SUCCESS within 30 minutes

4. **Monitor Ready Decisions:**
   ```bash
   psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM content_metadata WHERE status = 'queued' AND (scheduled_at IS NULL OR scheduled_at <= NOW() + INTERVAL '5 minutes') AND (is_test_post IS NULL OR is_test_post = false);"
   ```
   **Expected:** Count decreasing as decisions are processed

---

## Follow-up Actions

1. **Review source-of-truth check logic:** Ensure it only validates columns that exist for the decision type being processed
2. **Add monitoring:** Alert when posting queue skips processing due to schema checks
3. **Document schema requirements:** Clearly document which columns are required for which decision types
4. **Add integration tests:** Test posting queue with both reply and non-reply decisions

**Report Status:** ✅ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - FIX APPLIED**

## Verification Results (Post-Fix)

### Railway Logs Check (After Fix)
```bash
railway logs -n 100 | grep -E "(POSTING_QUEUE|SOURCE-OF-TRUTH)"
```

**Status:** ⏳ Waiting for deployment to complete (check in 2-3 minutes)

### POST_ATTEMPT Events (After Fix)
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM system_events WHERE event_type = 'POST_ATTEMPT' AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes';"
```

**Status:** ⏳ Waiting for deployment to complete (check in 2-3 minutes)

**Expected Results:**
- Railway logs should show: `✅ Source-of-truth check passed: core columns accessible`
- POST_ATTEMPT count should be > 0 within 10 minutes
- POST_SUCCESS should appear within 30 minutes

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ Fix applied and committed
2. ✅ Deployed to Railway
3. ⏳ Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
4. ⏳ Check Railway logs for successful schema check
5. ⏳ Monitor for POST_ATTEMPT events in next 10 minutes
6. ⏳ Verify POST_SUCCESS events appear within 30 minutes
