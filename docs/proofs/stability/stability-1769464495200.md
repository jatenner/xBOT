# Long-Running Executor Stability Proof (Phase 5A.3)

**Date:** 2026-01-26T21:55:10.540Z  
**Status:** ❌ FAIL
**Proof Tag:** stability-1769464495200
**Duration:** 30 minutes (actual: 0 minutes)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Primary: No gaps >90s between HEALTH_OK events ✅
- Secondary: ≥1 HEALTH_OK per ~60s (allows 1-minute scheduling slip: 0 events for 30 minutes is acceptable if ≥29)

## Machine Info

- **Hostname:** Mac-383.lan
- **Platform:** darwin
- **Architecture:** arm64
- **Node Version:** v22.14.0
- **Runner Profile Dir:** /Users/jonahtenner/Desktop/xBOT/.runner-profile

## Results

| Check | Status | Evidence | Assertion |
|-------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Boot Event (20s) | ❌ | N/A | HARD |
| Ready Event (90s) | ❌ | N/A | HARD |
| Health OK Events (≥1 per 60s) | ❌ | 0 events (expected: ≥30) | HARD |
| No Gaps >90s | ❌ | Max gap: 0.0s, Final gap: Infinitys | HARD |
| No Crash Events | ✅ | N/A | HARD |
| No Browser Pool Exhaustion | ✅ | None | HARD |
| Duration Completed | ❌ | 0/30 minutes | HARD |

## Evidence

- **Proof Tag:** stability-1769464495200
- **Boot Event ID:** N/A
- **Ready Event ID:** N/A
- **Health OK Event Count:** 0
- **Health OK Event IDs:** N/A
- **Max Health OK Gap:** 0.0s

- **Crash Event ID:** N/A
- **Browser Pool Exhaustion:** No

## Timeline Summary

- **Start Time:** 2026-01-26T21:54:55.201Z
- **End Time:** 2026-01-26T21:55:10.540Z
- **Duration:** 0 minutes
- **Health OK Events:** 0 events over 0 minutes (avg: 0.00 per minute)


## Termination / Early Exit Reason

**Duration Not Completed:** Proof ended after 0 minutes (expected: 30 minutes)

**Termination Details:**


- **STOP Switch Detected:** Yes (STOP_EXECUTOR file found)


- **Termination Time:** 2026-01-26T21:55:05.539Z

**Recommendation:** Re-run proof ensuring:
- No external processes send SIGTERM/SIGINT to proof script
- STOP_EXECUTOR file does not exist before/during proof
- System does not sleep/hibernate during proof (use `caffeinate` on macOS)
- Full 30-minute duration is allowed to complete


## Result

❌ **FAIL** - One or more stability checks failed
