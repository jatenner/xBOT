**Test Results Summary:**
```
🧪 DRY RUN VALIDATION RESULTS:
═══════════════════════════════════════

📊 6 Candidates Generated - ALL AUTHORITATIVE
🏆 Top Candidate: 93/100 overall score

```

---

## 📊 **SAMPLE OUTPUT: BEFORE vs AFTER**

### **❌ BEFORE (Diary-Style - UNACCEPTABLE)**
```
"I tried intermittent fasting for 30 days and the results were crazy! 
My energy levels went through the roof and I lost 8 pounds. 
Who knew skipping breakfast could make such a difference? 
You should definitely try this - it worked amazing for me! 🔥"

Authority Score: 15/100 (Personal anecdote, no evidence)
```

### **✅ AFTER (Authoritative - PROFESSIONAL)**
```
"🎯 HOOK: Contrary to popular belief, longer workout sessions 
may not be the most effective way to achieve fitness goals.

📊 EVIDENCE: Research from the American College of Sports Medicine 
shows that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for just 
15-20 minutes can be more effective than 60 minutes of moderate cardio. 
Studies reveal 40% greater fat loss and 25% more cardiovascular 
improvement with shorter, intense sessions.

✅ TAKEAWAY: Replace one long cardio session per week with 
20 minutes of HIIT - 30 seconds high intensity followed by 
90 seconds recovery, repeated 8 times."

Authority Score: 95/100 (Research citations + specific stats + actionable advice)
```
