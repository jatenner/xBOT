**Goal:** Every generator now has your exact baseline tweet as the GOLD STANDARD example

## **✅ UPDATED GENERATORS (12/12)**

### **1. DataNerd 📊** - UPDATED ✅
**Gold Standard:**
```
"Want a stat that'll change your bedtime tonight?
People who sleep less than 6 hours have a 200% higher risk of a heart attack in their lifetime.
Study: European Heart Journal, 2023.
No supplement on Earth fixes what chronic sleep steals."
```

### **2. Philosopher 💭** - UPDATED ✅
**Gold Standard:**
```
"Your body is the only place you're guaranteed to live in for the rest of your life.
Most people treat it like a rental.
Treat it like a home."
```

### **3. Coach 💪** - UPDATED ✅
**Gold Standard:**
```
"A morning routine that actually works (10 minutes):
✅ Step outside → 2 min of sunlight
✅ Breathe through your nose → 30 deep breaths
✅ Drink water before caffeine
✅ 10 squats or push-ups
No biohacks. Just biology."
```

### **4. NewsReporter 📰** - UPDATED ✅
**Gold Standard:**
```
"🚨 New Study: 8,000 steps a day cuts risk of early death by 51%.
Not 10,000. Not marathon training. Just ~60 minutes of walking.
Published today in JAMA Network Open.
The headline isn't 'fitness influencer secret.'
It's 'your neighborhood sidewalk is free medicine.'"
```

### **5. Storyteller 📖** - UPDATED ✅
**Gold Standard:**
```
"In 2009, a 69-year-old Japanese man had a heart attack. Doctors said he'd never run again.
He started walking 100 meters a day. Then 200. Then half a mile.
Today, he's completed 76 marathons.
He said: 'I didn't get younger. I just stopped giving up.'
Health isn't a miracle. It's momentum."
```

### **6. InterestingContent ✨** - UPDATED ✅
**Gold Standard:**
```
"Your heart beats 100,000 times a day.
But your gut bacteria? They produce 95% of your serotonin — the 'feel good' chemical.
Technically, your mood starts in your colon, not your head.
You don't just 'feel with your heart.'
You feel with your microbes."
```

### **7. Provocateur 🎯** - UPDATED ✅
**Gold Standard:**
```
"Why do we wait for a heart attack to start caring about the heart?
Why do people only stretch after they get injured?
Why do we treat health like an apology instead of a responsibility?
Prevention isn't boring. Regret is."
```

### **8. MythBuster 💥** - UPDATED ✅
**Gold Standard:**
```
"Myth: 'Your metabolism slows because you age.'
Reality: A study of 6,400 people (Science, 2021) found metabolism stays stable from age 20 to 60.
What slows? Movement. Muscle mass. Protein intake. Sleep.
Your metabolism didn't quit. Your habits did."
```

### **9. ThoughtLeader 🧠** - UPDATED ✅
**Gold Standard:**
```
"We're entering Health 3.0:
Health 1.0 — Treat disease
Health 2.0 — Track health (Fitbits, Apple Watches)
Health 3.0 — Predict and prevent disease before symptoms exist
Your phone will soon warn you of a heart attack days before it happens."
```

### **10. Contrarian 🔄** - UPDATED ✅
**Gold Standard:**
```
"Hot take: The gym isn't where most people lose weight.
It's the kitchen. It's their phone at 11:45pm. It's Uber Eats + boredom + stress.
You don't need a better workout plan.
You need a better 9pm–midnight plan."
```

### **11. Explorer 🌍** - UPDATED ✅
**Gold Standard:**
```
"People in Sardinia drink red wine daily.
Okinawans eat seaweed and purple sweet potatoes.
Ikarians take naps every afternoon.
Different habits. Same result — they live the longest.
Maybe longevity isn't a single diet.
Maybe it's living slow, eating real food, and laughing often."
```

### **12. HumanVoice 🗣️** - EXISTING SYSTEM ✅
**Note:** HumanVoice uses `humanVoiceEngine.ts` which already has multiple voice patterns built-in. This is more sophisticated than a single generator and doesn't need the same update pattern.

**User's baseline for reference:**
```
"Sometimes taking care of your health isn't about supplements or perfect routines.
It's choosing water over soda. Going for a 5-minute walk when you don't want to.
Answering 'I'm not okay' honestly.
Your body keeps score of the little things you do for it — and the little things you don't."
```

## **WHAT CHANGED:**

### **Before (Academic Style):**
```
❌ "Lally et al. 2009 (n=96): Average 66 days to form habit..."
❌ "Goyal et al. 2014, n=47 meditation study..."
❌ "Zhang et al. (n=1,000) revealed..."
```

### **After (Your Baseline Style):**

## **KEY IMPROVEMENTS:**

1. **No more academic citations** - No "et al." or "(n=X)" in prompts
2. **Simple source format** - "Study: [Journal], [Year]" or "[Institution] tracked [number] people"
3. **Memorable closing lines** - Every example ends with something quotable
4. **Specific numbers** - But presented naturally (8,000 steps, 200% risk)
5. **Emotional resonance** - Data + feeling combined
6. **Concrete examples** - Real places, real people, real actions
