# ðŸš‚ Railway CLI - Fixed & Ready

## Problem Identified

The Railway CLI has an **expired/missing authentication token** in `~/.railway/config.json`. While `RAILWAY_TOKEN` is set as an environment variable, the CLI doesn't read it from there - it reads from the config file.

## Solution (Choose One)

### Option 1: Quick Fix with Script (RECOMMENDED)

Simply run the fix script I created:

```bash
./fix-railway-auth.sh
```

This will:
1. Open your browser for Railway login
2. Prompt you to select the xBOT project
3. Test the connection

### Option 2: Manual Steps

If you prefer to do it manually:

```bash
# 1. Login (opens browser)
railway login

# 2. Link to project
railway link
# Select "xBOT" from the list

# 3. Test it works
railway status
npm run logs
```

### Option 3: Use API Token Directly

If the CLI continues to have issues, you can use the Railway GraphQL API directly (already set up):

```bash
# The railway-logs.js script uses the GraphQL API
# It reads from RAILWAY_TOKEN environment variable
npm run logs:live
npm run logs:follow
```

## How to Get a Railway Token

If you need a fresh token:

1. Go to https://railway.app/account/tokens
2. Create new token: "CLI Access"
3. Copy the token
4. Add to your shell profile:
   ```bash
   export RAILWAY_TOKEN="your_token_here"
   ```

## What I Fixed

1. âœ… Created `fix-railway-auth.sh` - automated authentication script
2. âœ… Verified `bulletproof_railway_monitor.js` - correctly uses `railway logs` without `--follow` flag
3. âœ… Confirmed `railway-logs.js` - uses GraphQL API as backup (works without CLI)
4. âœ… Package.json scripts - all correctly configured

## Testing After Fix

```bash
# Test Railway CLI
railway status

# Test log viewing
npm run logs

# Test live logs
npm run logs:follow

# Test bulletproof monitor
npm run logs:monitor
```

## Files That Work With/Without CLI

- âœ… `railway-logs.js` - Uses GraphQL API (no CLI needed)
- âœ… `bulletproof_railway_monitor.js` - Uses CLI but auto-reconnects
- âœ… All npm scripts in package.json

## Next Steps

1. Run `./fix-railway-auth.sh`
2. Test with `npm run logs`
3. You're done! ðŸŽ‰
