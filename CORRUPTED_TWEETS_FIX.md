# 🔧 CORRUPTED TWEETS ISSUE - FIXED

## 🚨 Problem Identified

Your bot was posting tweets with **corrupted Unicode characters** (like `��` symbols) because of encoding issues in the prompt file.

## 🔍 Root Cause

**File**: `src/prompts/tweetPrompt.txt`
**Issue**: Line 1 contained corrupted Unicode characters:

```
BEFORE: �� **SNAP2HEALTH AI - BREAKTHROUGH HEALTH TECH INSIGHTS** 🏥
AFTER:  🚀 **SNAP2HEALTH AI - BREAKTHROUGH HEALTH TECH INSIGHTS** 🏥
```

The `��` characters were **corrupted emoji** that got mangled during file encoding, causing the AI to generate tweets with similar corrupted symbols.

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Corrupted Prompt File**
- Replaced `��` with proper `🚀` emoji
- Ensured proper UTF-8 encoding

### 2. **Added Unicode Validation**
Enhanced `contentSanity.ts` with new checks:
- Detects corrupted Unicode replacement characters (`��`, `\uFFFD`)
- Catches encoding errors (`â€™`, `â€œ`, etc.)
- Rejects tweets with corrupted characters before posting

### 3. **Prevention System**
The bot now automatically rejects any content containing:
- Unicode replacement characters
- Control characters
- Common encoding error patterns
- Corrupted symbol sequences

## 📊 Expected Results

**Before Fix:**
```
❌ Tweets with: "�� weird symbols and ��� corrupted text"
❌ Unreadable content with strange characters
❌ Poor user experience
```

**After Fix:**
```
✅ Clean, readable tweets with proper emojis
✅ Professional appearance
✅ Automatic corruption detection and prevention
```

## 🚀 Deployment Status

- ✅ **Prompt file fixed**: Corrupted characters removed
- ✅ **Validation added**: Content sanity checks enhanced
- ✅ **Code deployed**: Changes pushed to Render
- ✅ **Prevention active**: Future corruption blocked

## 🔍 How to Verify Fix

1. **Monitor new tweets**: Should no longer contain `��` or similar symbols
2. **Check content quality**: Tweets should be clean and readable
3. **Validation logs**: Bot will log if it rejects corrupted content

## 📋 Prevention Tips

To avoid future corruption:
1. **Always use UTF-8 encoding** when editing prompt files
2. **Copy emojis directly** instead of using Unicode codes
3. **Test locally** before deploying prompt changes
4. **Monitor tweet quality** regularly
