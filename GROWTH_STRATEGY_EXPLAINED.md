## 📊 WHAT MAKES PEOPLE FOLLOW YOU

### **The Follow Decision:**

People follow you when:
1. **You provide unique value** they can't get elsewhere
2. **Your content is consistently interesting** (not boring)
3. **You prove expertise** through threads/deep content
4. **They discover you** through strategic replies
5. **Your profile looks good** (bio + pinned tweet)

### **What Your System Tracks (F/1K Metric):**

**F/1K = Followers per 1000 Impressions**

This is THE metric that matters:
- **High F/1K** = People who see your content follow you
- **Low F/1K** = People see your content but don't follow

**Example:**
- Post gets 1000 views, gains 5 followers = F/1K of 5
- Post gets 1000 views, gains 1 follower = F/1K of 1
- **Higher F/1K = better content = more followers**
