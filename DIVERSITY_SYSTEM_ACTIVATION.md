   - AI generates unique voices/styles
   - Avoids last 10 tones (rolling blacklist)
   - Temperature: 1.2
   - Unlimited tones (casual, academic, skeptical, enthusiastic, etc.)

üö´ Last 10 topics: [list of recent topics]
üö´ Last 10 angles: [list of recent angles]
üö´ Last 10 tones: [list of recent tones]

üéØ TOPIC: "[AI-generated topic]"

   Viral potential: [0.0-1.0]

üìê ANGLE: "[AI-generated angle]"

```

**These logs will confirm diversity system is running!**

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN NEXT

### **Immediate (Next Content Generation):**
- Diversity logs appear in Railway
- Topic/angle/tone generated and shown
- Random generator selected

### **Database (After First Post):**
```sql
SELECT raw_topic, angle, tone, generator_name 
FROM content_metadata 
WHERE posted_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

Expected:
- raw_topic: "NAD+ precursors" (or similar)
- angle: "Celebrity protocol secrets" (or similar)
- tone: "Enthusiastic investigative" (or similar)
- generator_name: "contrarian" (or any of 11)

NOT NULL anymore!
```

### **Content Variety (After 10 Posts):**
```
Post 1: Cold showers | Biology mechanisms | Academic formal | dataNerd
Post 2: NAD+ | Celebrity protocols | Casual storytelling | storyteller  
Post 3: Supplements | Industry rankings | Skeptical investigative | contrarian
Post 4: Sleep | Influencer routines | Enthusiastic coaching | coach
Post 5: Gut health | Research breakthrough | Direct prescriptive | mythBuster
...etc (all different!)
```

## üîç VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

### **Step 1: Check Deployment (5 minutes)**
- [ ] Railway shows "Deployed" status
- [ ] No build errors
- [ ] Service running

### **Step 2: Wait for Next Plan Job (~30 min)**
- [ ] Plan job scheduled to run (check logs)
- [ ] Look for diversity system logs
- [ ] Confirm topic/angle/tone appear

### **Step 3: Check Database (After first post)**
```sql
SELECT raw_topic, angle, tone, generator_name 
FROM content_metadata 
ORDER BY posted_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```
- [ ] raw_topic is NOT NULL
- [ ] angle is NOT NULL
- [ ] tone is NOT NULL
- [ ] generator_name is NOT NULL

### **Step 4: Read the Actual Post**
- [ ] Go to @SignalAndSynapse Twitter
- [ ] Read the latest post
- [ ] Does it sound different from previous posts?
- [ ] Is the topic fresh/interesting?

### **Step 5: Monitor for 24 Hours**
- [ ] Check next 5-10 posts
- [ ] Are they diverse?
- [ ] Different topics/angles/tones?
- [ ] Or still repetitive?

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING (If Still Not Diverse)

### **If Diversity Logs Don't Appear:**
- Check if planJob.ts is actually being imported
- Check for import errors in logs
- Verify diversity modules exist

### **If Logs Appear But Content Still Repetitive:**
- Check the actual topics/angles/tones being generated
- Prompts might be too constraining
- Temperature might be too low
- Generator personalities might be too similar

### **If Database Fields Still NULL:**
- Check queueContent() function
- Verify field mapping is correct
- Check for insert errors
