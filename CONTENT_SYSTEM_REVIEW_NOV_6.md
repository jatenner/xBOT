## 🔧 METADATA TRACKING

### ⚠️ Issue Identified:

Database shows:
- ✅ `generator_name` - **STORED** (Coach, dynamicContent, explorer, etc.)
- ❌ `raw_topic` - **NOT STORED** (showing "unknown")
- ❌ `angle` - **NOT STORED** (showing "unknown")
- ❌ `tone` - **NOT STORED** (showing "unknown")
- ❌ `format_strategy` - **NOT STORED** (showing "unknown")

### Impact:

**System Impact:** ⚠️ **MINOR**
- Content IS being generated correctly
- Generators ARE being used
- Quality IS high
- Diversity IS working

**Analytics Impact:** ⚠️ **MODERATE**
- Can't analyze which topics perform best
- Can't optimize angle/tone combinations
- Can't track format strategy effectiveness
- Limits learning system's ability to optimize

### Cause:

Likely the `formatAndQueueContent()` function in `planJob.ts` isn't extracting and storing the metadata fields that the new system generates.

**Status:** Non-critical but should be fixed for analytics

## 📋 RECOMMENDATIONS

### Optional Improvements (Non-urgent):

1. **Fix metadata storage** - Add topic/angle/tone to database writes
2. **Monitor generator performance** - Track which generators get best engagement
3. **Optimize thread rate** - Currently 14%, could A/B test different rates
4. **Track angle effectiveness** - See which angles (provocative vs educational) perform best

**But these are optimizations - your core system is working great!**
