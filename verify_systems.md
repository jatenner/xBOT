# 🔍 SYSTEM VERIFICATION REPORT

## ✅ All Schema Fixes Deployed (Git commits):
1. `76d7cb32` - Fixed reply opportunities schema (target_username, target_tweet_id, tweet_posted_at)
2. `c7c3a39a` - Fixed reply queueing (removed estimated_reach column)
3. `80fed2cc` - Fixed plan job schema (removed content_id, fixed column names)

## 📊 Current Status:

### Regular Posting System:
- **Plan Job Schedule**: Every 30 minutes (last run: 23:13, next: 23:43)
- **Fixed Issues**:
  - ❌ Was trying to insert `content_id` (doesn't exist)
  - ❌ Was using `topic` instead of `topic_cluster`
  - ❌ Was using decision_type: 'content' instead of 'single'
  - ✅ NOW FIXED: Uses correct schema

### Reply System:
- **Reply Job Schedule**: Every 60 minutes (runs at :15 past the hour)
- **Harvester Schedule**: Every 30 minutes (populates opportunity pool)
- **Fixed Issues**:
  - ❌ Opportunities weren't storing (wrong column names)
  - ❌ Replies weren't queueing (estimated_reach column missing)
  - ✅ NOW FIXED: Uses correct schema

## 🎯 Next Steps:
1. Wait for plan job at 23:43 to verify regular posts queue
2. Wait for reply job at next :15 to verify replies queue
3. Both should now successfully insert into content_metadata table

## 🔧 Independent Verification:
Both systems work independently:
- **Regular Posts**: Plan Job → content_metadata → Posting Queue → Twitter
- **Replies**: Reply Harvester → reply_opportunities → Reply Job → content_metadata → Posting Queue → Twitter

No dependencies between the two systems.
