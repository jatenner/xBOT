# üîß SUPABASE SCHEMA CACHE REFRESH NEEDED

## THE ISSUE:
Your system generated NEW diverse content with meta-awareness, but Supabase won't accept it because its API cache doesn't know about the new columns yet.

## THE FIX:
**Go to Supabase Dashboard and reload the schema:**

### **Option 1: API Settings (Easiest)**
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
4. Scroll down to **Schema Cache**
5. Click **Reload schema** button

### **Option 2: Run a Simple Query (Forces refresh)**
1. Go to **SQL Editor**
2. Run this:
```sql
SELECT column_name 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'content_metadata' 
AND column_name IN ('angle_type', 'tone_cluster', 'topic_cluster', 'structural_type', 'tone_is_singular');
```

This query forces PostgREST to refresh its cache.

### **Option 3: Restart PostgREST (Nuclear option)**
If above doesn't work:
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**  
2. Click **Restart API server**

## WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW:

Your logs show the NEW system IS working:

‚úÖ **Meta-awareness active:**
- Sampling from "bold" tone cluster (not neutral!)
- Using "chaotic" structural type (not clean/scannable!)
- Provocateur generator called

‚úÖ **Diversity happening:**
- Topic: Cultural angle on semaglutide popularity
- Tone: Singular "Unfiltered urgency" 
- Format: Chaotic flow structure

‚ùå **Can't save to database:**
```
Could not find the 'angle_type' column in schema cache
```

---

## AFTER REFRESH:

1. The queued content will start saving
2. Your next posts (in ~1 hour) will show diversity
3. System will work normally

**Do the schema reload and the system will be fully operational!** üöÄ
