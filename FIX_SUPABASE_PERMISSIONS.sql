-- üîì FIX SUPABASE PERMISSIONS
-- =============================
-- This script ensures your Service Role can access all tables

-- üö® DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY (RLS) for all tables
-- RLS blocks service role access even though it should have full permissions

ALTER TABLE bot_config DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE tweets DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE twitter_quota_tracking DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE engagement_history DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE daily_budget_status DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE system_logs DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE content_uniqueness DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE expert_learning_data DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE budget_transactions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- üîß GRANT FULL PERMISSIONS to service_role (should already exist, but ensuring)
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO service_role;
GRANT ALL ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO service_role;
GRANT ALL ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA public TO service_role;

-- üîß GRANT USAGE on public schema
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO service_role;
