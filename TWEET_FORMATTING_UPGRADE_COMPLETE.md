## 📊 **SPECIFIC TWEET TRANSFORMATIONS**

### **Blue Light Sleep Tweet:**

**🚫 BEFORE:**
```
🚨 Everything you've heard about blue light disrupting your sleep is completely wrong. Here's why: 🍳 1/ The idea that blue light from screens ruins sleep is a myth. The REAL issue? Your overall light exposure throughout the day. 2/ Experts I work with (💡) say it's about maintaining a consistent light schedule, not eliminating screens. 3/ Studies show natural daylight exposure is key. People who spend more time outside report better sleep. 4/ If you're only focusing on cutting screen time, you're missing the bigger picture. Don't let outdated info hold you back. 5/ ☀️ Want better sleep? Prioritize natural light. Start a new morning routine, and watch your sleep transform. ✨ Share your sleep tips or challenge this take! Retweet if you're ready for a restful night. 💤 #SleepScience #HealthMyths
