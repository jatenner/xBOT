# 🌾 REPLY OPPORTUNITY HARVESTER - DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE

## 📊 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

```
✅ Discovered accounts: 24 (good!)
❌ Reply opportunities: 0 (BLOCKED HERE!)
❌ Queued replies: 0
❌ Posted replies: 0
```

**Root cause:** The system was discovering accounts but **NOT scraping their tweets** to create reply opportunities.

---

## 🎯 **USER REQUIREMENTS**

1. **Reply to 100+ tweets/day** (3-4 per hour)
2. **Only reply to tweets <24 hours old**
3. **Keep 200-300 opportunities in pool** (never run out)
4. **Continuously replenish** as opportunities are used

---

## 🔧 **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Reply Opportunity Harvester Job**
**File:** `src/jobs/replyOpportunityHarvester.ts`

A dedicated job that:
- ✅ Checks current pool size (filters for <24h tweets)
- ✅ Harvests from 10-20 accounts per cycle
- ✅ Targets 200-300 opportunities in pool
- ✅ Cleans up old opportunities (>24h)
- ✅ Runs every 30 minutes
- ✅ Smart: Only harvests when pool is low

**Key Logic:**
```typescript
const MIN_POOL_SIZE = 100;
const TARGET_POOL_SIZE = 300;

if (poolSize >= TARGET_POOL_SIZE) {
  console.log('Pool is full, skipping harvest');
  return;
}

// Filter for <24 hours old
const fresh = opportunities.filter(opp => {
  if (!opp.tweet_posted_at) return false;
  const tweetAge = Date.now() - new Date(opp.tweet_posted_at).getTime();
  return tweetAge < 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
});
```

---

### **2. Job Manager Integration**
**File:** `src/jobs/jobManager.ts`

Registered harvester with staggered scheduling:
```
• First run: 10 minutes after startup
• Then: Every 30 minutes
• Offset: 10 minutes (after account discovery at 5 min)
```

This ensures:
- Account discovery runs first (discovers new accounts)
- Harvester runs 5 minutes later (scrapes their tweets)
- Continuous replenishment cycle

---

### **3. <24 Hour Filtering in Decision Engine**
**File:** `src/ai/replyDecisionEngine.ts`

Updated `filterRecentTargets()` to enforce tweet age:
```typescript
// Filter 1: Not recently replied to
if (recentUsernames.has(target.username?.toLowerCase())) {
  return false;
}

// Filter 2: Only tweets <24h old
if (target.tweet_posted_at) {
  const tweetAge = new Date(target.tweet_posted_at).getTime();
  if (Date.now() - tweetAge > 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) {
    console.log(`Skipping @${target.username} - tweet too old`);
    return false;
  }
}
```

This is a **double-safety mechanism**:
- Harvester filters at collection time
- Decision engine filters at selection time

---

### **4. TypeScript Interface Update**
**File:** `src/ai/realTwitterDiscovery.ts`

Added `tweet_posted_at` to `ReplyOpportunity` interface:
```typescript
export interface ReplyOpportunity {
  // ... existing fields ...
  tweet_posted_at?: string; // ISO timestamp - needed for <24h filtering
  opportunity_score: number;
}
```

## 📈 **HOW IT WORKS**

### **Full Reply System Flow:**

```
STEP 1: Account Discovery (every 30 min)
  ↓
  Finds accounts: @drmarkhyman, @PeterAttiaMD, etc.
  ↓
  Stores in discovered_accounts table
  ↓
STEP 2: Opportunity Harvester (every 30 min, offset 10 min)
  ↓
  Checks pool: 50 opportunities (<24h old)
  ↓
  Needs: 250 more to reach target (300)
  ↓
  Scrapes 20 accounts → finds 280 tweets
  ↓
  Filters for <24h → 250 fresh tweets
  ↓
  Stores in reply_opportunities table
  ↓
  Cleans up old tweets (>24h)
  ↓
STEP 3: Reply Job (every 15 min)
  ↓
  Checks pool: 300 opportunities available
  ↓
  AI Decision Engine ranks opportunities
  ↓
  Filters for <24h (double-check)
  ↓
  Generates 3-5 strategic replies
  ↓
  Stores in content_metadata (decision_type='reply')
  ↓
STEP 4: Posting Queue (every 5 min)
  ↓
  Posts replies to Twitter
  ↓
  Marks opportunities as used
  ↓
LOOP BACK TO STEP 1
```

## 🎯 **DEPLOYMENT STATUS**

### **✅ Live System Logs:**

```bash
[JOB_MANAGER] ℹ️ Account pool status: low (24 accounts) - reply system ready
🕒 JOB_MANAGER: Scheduling reply - first run in 900s, then every 15min
🕒 JOB_MANAGER: Scheduling reply_harvester - first run in 600s, then every 30min
```

### **Timeline:**
- **T+0min:** System starts
- **T+5min:** Account discovery runs
- **T+10min:** 🌾 **Harvester runs for first time** (scrapes 20 accounts)
- **T+15min:** Reply job runs (generates replies from harvested opportunities)
- **T+30min:** Posting queue posts first replies
- **T+40min:** Harvester runs again (replenishes pool)

---

## 📊 **EXPECTED RESULTS**

### **After 1 hour:**
- Discovered accounts: 24+ (continuous discovery)
- Reply opportunities: 200-300 (<24h old)
- Queued replies: 5-10 (ready to post)
- Posted replies: 3-6 (on Twitter)

### **After 24 hours:**
- Discovered accounts: 50+ (growing)
- Reply opportunities: Stable at 200-300 (continuously replenished)
- Posted replies: ~100 (3-4 per hour × 24 hours)

---

## 🔍 **VERIFICATION COMMANDS**

### **Check pool status:**
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_opportunities,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE tweet_posted_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours') as fresh_opportunities
FROM reply_opportunities;
```

### **Check harvester activity:**
```bash
railway logs | grep "\[HARVESTER\]"
```

Expected output:
```
[HARVESTER] 🌾 Starting reply opportunity harvesting...
[HARVESTER] 📊 Current pool: 50 opportunities (<24h old)
[HARVESTER] 🎯 Need to harvest ~250 opportunities
[HARVESTER] 🌐 Scraping 20 accounts...
[HARVESTER] ✓ Found 15 fresh opportunities (<24h)
[HARVESTER] ✅ Harvest complete!
[HARVESTER] 📊 Pool size: 50 → 300
```

### **Check reply generation:**
```bash
railway logs | grep "\[REPLY_JOB\]"
```

Expected output:
```
[REPLY_JOB] 💬 Starting reply generation cycle...
[REPLY_JOB] ✅ Reply quota available: 0/6 this hour
[REPLY_JOB] 🔍 Searching for reply opportunities...
[REPLY_JOB] ✅ Found 300 reply opportunities
[REPLY_JOB] 🚀 AGGRESSIVE MODE: Generating 5 strategic replies
```

- Prevents over-harvesting (saves resources)

### **2. Freshness Guarantee**
- All opportunities <24 hours old
- Auto-cleanup of stale opportunities
- Double-filtering (harvest + selection)

### **3. Rate Limit Friendly**
- 3-second delay between account scrapes
- Stops early if target reached
- Scrapes max 20 accounts per cycle

### **4. Self-Healing**
- If pool is empty, harvester prioritizes it
