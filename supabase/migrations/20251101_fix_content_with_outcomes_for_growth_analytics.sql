-- FIX content_with_outcomes VIEW FOR GROWTH ANALYTICS
-- =====================================================================================
-- Problem: The view is missing critical columns needed by growth analytics:
--   - actual_impressions (has 'impressions' but growth analytics expects 'actual_impressions')
--   - raw_topic, generator_name, visual_format, tone, angle, format_strategy
--
-- Solution: Recreate view to include ALL columns from content_generation_metadata_comprehensive
-- =====================================================================================

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS content_with_outcomes CASCADE;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW content_with_outcomes AS
SELECT 
    -- From content_generation_metadata_comprehensive (all columns)
    cm.*,
    
    -- From outcomes table (if exists) - use COALESCE to prefer outcomes data over cm data
    COALESCE(o.likes, cm.actual_likes) as likes,
    COALESCE(o.retweets, cm.actual_retweets) as retweets,
    COALESCE(o.replies, cm.actual_replies) as replies,
    COALESCE(o.bookmarks, 0) as bookmarks,
    COALESCE(o.quotes, 0) as quotes,
    COALESCE(o.views, cm.actual_impressions) as views,
    COALESCE(o.profile_clicks, 0) as profile_clicks,
    COALESCE(o.engagement_rate, cm.actual_engagement_rate) as engagement_rate,
    o.followers_gained,
    o.followers_before,
    o.followers_after,
    o.collected_at,
    o.collected_pass,
    o.data_source
FROM content_generation_metadata_comprehensive cm
LEFT JOIN outcomes o ON cm.decision_id = o.decision_id
WHERE cm.status = 'posted'
  AND cm.tweet_id IS NOT NULL;
