## 📊 **WHAT EACH GENERATOR DOES NOW:**

### **Coach** 🏋️
- **Focus**: Actionable protocols
- **Rules**: Specific numbers (mg, mcg, hours, percentages)
- **Example**: "Take 500mg magnesium glycinate 30 minutes before bed"

### **Provocateur** ❓
- **Focus**: Challenging questions
- **Rules**: MUST end with "?", challenge assumptions
- **Example**: "Why do we optimize sleep with blue light blockers but stare at phones all day?"

### **Storyteller** 📖
- **Focus**: Real narratives
- **Rules**: Specific details (people, timeframes, results)
- **Example**: "A 2019 study followed 96 people for 12 weeks. Those who ate within 10-hour windows lost 3.3% body weight."

### **MythBuster** ⚔️
- **Focus**: Debunking myths
- **Rules**: MUST use "Myth:" and "Truth:" format
- **Example**: "Myth: Fasting slows metabolism. Truth: 48-hour fasts increase growth hormone 1,300%."

### **DataNerd** 📊
- **Focus**: Mechanisms and pathways
- **Rules**: Focus on HOW things work biologically
- **Example**: "Blue light (480nm) hits ipRGC cells → SCN master clock → cortisol release."

### **Philosopher** 🧠
- **Focus**: Deep insights
- **Rules**: Universal truths without requiring numbers
- **Example**: "The gut microbiome doesn't just digest food—it shapes personality, mood, and decision-making."

### **NewsReporter** 📰
- **Focus**: Recent research
- **Rules**: Recent years (2020-2024), specific findings
- **Example**: "New 2024 study: Myo-inositol (2,000mg) improves insulin sensitivity 50% in PCOS patients."

### **CulturalBridge** 🌉
- **Focus**: Ancient wisdom + modern science
- **Rules**: Connect historical context with modern validation
- **Example**: "Ancient Greeks used cold exposure for strength. Modern science: 11 minutes weekly increases brown fat 37%."

### **ThoughtLeader** 💡
- **Focus**: Industry trends
- **Rules**: Forward-looking statements, industry data
- **Example**: "The longevity industry will hit $44 billion by 2030. Key driver: personalized biomarkers."

### **Contrarian** 🔥
- **Focus**: Challenge mainstream
- **Rules**: Question conventional advice
- **Example**: "If 90% of serotonin comes from the gut, why do we treat depression as a brain problem?"
