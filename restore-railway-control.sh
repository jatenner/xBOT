echo "STRATEGY A: Wait for Rate Limit (Current Status)"
echo "------------------------------------------------"

echo "STRATEGY B: Use Different Network (Immediate)"
echo "--------------------------------------------"

echo "3. Authenticate in browser"
echo ""

echo "STRATEGY C: Use Railway Web Dashboard (Works Now)"
echo "------------------------------------------------"
echo "For immediate control while CLI is rate limited:"
echo "1. https://railway.app ‚Üí xBOT ‚Üí Settings"
echo "2. Manual redeploy via dashboard"
echo "3. Variable management via web interface"

# Step 5: Deployment Methods

echo "METHOD 2: Railway Up (Direct Deploy)"
echo "-----------------------------------"
echo "Once Railway CLI is working:"
echo "1. railway up"
echo "2. Deploys current local code directly"
echo "3. Bypasses git entirely"
echo ""

echo "METHOD 3: Manual Redeploy (Works Now)"
echo "------------------------------------"
echo "Via Railway dashboard:"
echo "1. Go to https://railway.app ‚Üí xBOT"
echo "2. Click 'Redeploy' button"
echo "3. Uses latest code from GitHub"

# Step 6: Immediate Actions

echo "   PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSER_ARGS=--no-sandbox,--disable-dev-shm-usage"

echo "Check every 15 minutes:"

echo "üéØ SUMMARY"
echo "=========="
echo ""
echo "The issue: Railway rate limited our IP from too many auth attempts"
echo "The fix: Wait 30-60 minutes, then railway login will work"
echo "Meanwhile: Use Railway dashboard for urgent changes"
