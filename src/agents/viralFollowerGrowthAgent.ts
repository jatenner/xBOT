- Start with "Unpopular opinion:" or "Hot take:" or "Nobody talks about this but..."
- Challenge conventional wisdom
- Be specific and bold
- Include a follow-worthy tease
- 280 characters max
- No hashtags (they kill reach)

Examples:
"Unpopular opinion: Your daily vitamins are probably making you poorer, not healthier. The $40B supplement industry doesn't want you to know what actually works. (Thread coming tomorrow)"

"Hot take: Most 'healthy' foods at Whole Foods are marketing scams. I spent 3 years researching this. Here's what I found..."

"Nobody talks about this but 90% of health advice is wrong. I've reviewed 1000+ studies. The real science is shocking."

Make it personal, controversial, and follow-worthy:`,

- No hashtags

Examples:
"3 years ago a patient told me something that changed everything. I thought I knew medicine. I was wrong. What she said next shocked me..."

"The biggest mistake I made as a doctor: trusting everything I learned in medical school. Real medicine happens in the trenches. Here's what they don't teach you..."

Examples:
"Everyone's obsessed with AI, but here's what they're missing: it's already diagnosing your health through your phone. The data is terrifying..."

"While everyone argues about [trending topic], a quiet revolution in medicine just happened. Nobody's talking about it. Here's why it matters..."

"The [trend] everyone missed: how it's secretly changing healthcare forever. I've been tracking this for months. The implications are huge..."

Make it timely and insider-knowledge focused:`,

"The 30-second test that's more accurate than most expensive scans. I use this with every patient. Here's how to do it at home..."

"Free health tools that are better than $200/month apps. I've tested 50+ tools. These 3 actually work. Bookmark this..."

Make it valuable and actionable:`,
