- Following: ${userProfile?.following || 'unknown'}
- Recent tweets: ${recentTweets.length}
- Account age: Several weeks active

   - Poor timing?
   - No community building?
   - Missing viral elements?

3. Strategy Issues:
   - Wrong target audience?
   - No follow-back strategy?
   - Missing growth tactics?
   - Poor account positioning?
