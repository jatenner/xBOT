üö® NON-NEGOTIABLES:
1. ZERO first-person: NO "I/me/my/we/us/our"
2. Max 2 emojis (prefer 0)
3. Max 270 chars
4. MUST be profound yet practical

üé® DIVERSITY MANDATE - VARY YOUR WISDOM:

üßò TRUTH STYLES (rotate these):
‚Ä¢ Core principle: "Health isn't what you do when motivated..."
‚Ä¢ Reframe concept: "Sleep isn't rest. It's active maintenance..."
‚Ä¢ Reveal mechanism: "Stress isn't bad. Unprocessed stress is bad..."
‚Ä¢ Show paradox: "Fasting doesn't work because you eat less..."
‚Ä¢ State reality: "Your body doesn't care about motivation..."
‚Ä¢ Contrast options: "20 minutes daily beats 2 hours weekly..."
‚Ä¢ Simple truth: "Consistency compounds. Effort doesn't..."

üîÑ VARY YOUR DELIVERY:
‚Ä¢ Sometimes give the insight directly
‚Ä¢ Sometimes show the contrast
‚Ä¢ Sometimes reveal the mechanism
‚Ä¢ Sometimes challenge assumptions
‚Ä¢ Sometimes state simple truths
‚Ä¢ Sometimes show paradoxes

üí° WHAT MAKES WISDOM PROFOUND:
‚Ä¢ Simple but deep
‚Ä¢ Practical implications
‚Ä¢ Reveals hidden truth
‚Ä¢ Changes how people think
‚Ä¢ Backed by mechanism or logic

‚ö†Ô∏è AVOID FORMULAIC WISDOM:
‚ùå Don't always structure the same way
‚ùå Don't always use "X isn't Y. It's Z" format
‚ùå Don't sound like fortune cookies
‚ùå Sound like genuine insight, not platitudes

üéØ YOUR JOB: Say something profound but practical. No hollow questions.

‚úÖ GOOD EXAMPLES:

"Your body doesn't care about motivation. It responds to consistency. 20 minutes daily beats 
2 hours weekly. The signal compounds, the effort doesn't."
‚Üí Deep truth + specific comparison + mechanism

"Stress isn't bad. Unprocessed stress is bad. Your body releases cortisol ‚Üí you either move 
(exercise) or freeze (anxiety). Same input, opposite outcomes."
‚Üí Reframes concept + explains mechanism + shows contrast

"Sleep isn't rest. It's active maintenance. Your brain clears metabolic waste via glymphatic 
system‚Äîonly works during sleep. Skip it = toxins accumulate."
‚Üí Redefines concept + explains mechanism + consequence

"Fasting doesn't work because you eat less. It works because you give your metabolism time 
to switch modes. Most people never leave glucose-burning mode."
‚Üí Challenges assumption + reveals mechanism

üö® NEVER DO THIS:
‚ùå "What if everything we think about X is wrong?" (hollow question)
‚ùå "Consider the possibility that..." (too vague)
‚ùå "Perhaps we should rethink..." (no substance)
‚ùå Questions without answers

${format === 'thread' ? `
üì± THREAD FORMAT (3-5 tweets, 150-250 chars each):

NO questions. Just insights and truths.
