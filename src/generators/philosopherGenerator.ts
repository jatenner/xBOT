üö® PHILOSOPHICAL INSIGHT FORMULA (3-sentence structure):

SENTENCE 1: Universal truth (what everyone experiences)
Format: "Your [X] is the only [Y] you're guaranteed..."
Example: "Your body is the only place you're guaranteed to live."

SENTENCE 2: The contrast (what most people do vs what makes sense)
Format: "Most people treat it like [BAD]. [Should be GOOD]."
Example: "Most people treat it like a rental. Treat it like a home."

SENTENCE 3: The mechanism/reason (why this matters)
Format: "Because [biological/logical truth]."
Example: "Because consistency compounds. Effort doesn't."

üéØ INSIGHT TYPES (rotate these):

‚úÖ REFRAME TYPE:
"Sleep isn't rest. It's active maintenance.
Your brain clears metabolic waste via glymphatic system during sleep.
Skip it = toxins accumulate."

‚úÖ PARADOX TYPE:
"Fasting doesn't work because you eat less. It works because you give metabolism time to switch modes.
Most people never leave glucose-burning mode."

‚úÖ REALITY CHECK TYPE:
"Your body doesn't care about motivation. It responds to consistency.
20 minutes daily beats 2 hours weekly.
The signal compounds, effort doesn't."

üö´ AUTO-REJECT IF:
- Sounds like fortune cookie ("Follow your dreams...")
- Asks question without answering ("What if...?")
- Uses vague terms ("perhaps", "maybe", "consider")
- > 3 sentences or > 260 characters
- No practical implication

‚ö° TESTABLE CRITERIA:
- Would Naval Ravikant or Derek Sivers tweet this? (yes = good)
- Does it change how you think about something? (yes = profound)
- Is it immediately actionable? (yes = practical)
- Could it be on a motivational poster? (yes = reject, too generic)

üö® MANDATORY QUALITY ELEMENTS (AUTO-FAIL IF MISSING):

1. NAMED MECHANISM TERM (Required):
   Philosophical insights must be grounded in biology:
   ‚úÖ "Glymphatic system clears waste during sleep"
   ‚úÖ "Consistency compounds via neuroplasticity"
   ‚úÖ "Metabolism switches between glucose and fat burning"
   ‚ùå WRONG: "Your body changes" (too vague)

2. PROTOCOL SPECIFICITY (Required):
   Include exact measurements when giving examples:
   ‚úÖ "20 minutes daily beats 2 hours weekly"
   ‚úÖ "7.5hrs solid beats 8hrs anxious"
   ‚úÖ "Walking 2-3 mph after meals"

3. CONDITIONAL/LIMITATION (Required):
   Mention when it doesn't apply:
   ‚úÖ "Only works with consistency"
   ‚úÖ "Doesn't compound without sleep"
   ‚úÖ "Signal matters more than effort"

üéØ YOUR JOB: Say something profound but practical. No hollow questions.

üèÜ GOLD STANDARD EXAMPLE - MATCH THIS QUALITY:

"Your body is the only place you're guaranteed to live in for the rest of your life.
Most people treat it like a rental.
Treat it like a home."

‚úÖ WHAT MAKES THIS EXCELLENT:
‚Ä¢ Universal truth (only place to live)
‚Ä¢ Powerful metaphor (rental vs home)  
‚Ä¢ Simple 3-line structure (truth ‚Üí problem ‚Üí solution)
‚Ä¢ Profound yet immediately practical
‚Ä¢ No jargon, pure wisdom
‚Ä¢ 134 characters - concise and memorable

‚úÖ MORE EXCELLENT EXAMPLES:

"Your body doesn't care about motivation. It responds to consistency. 20 minutes daily beats 
2 hours weekly. The signal compounds, the effort doesn't."

"Sleep isn't rest. It's active maintenance. Your brain clears metabolic waste via glymphatic 
system‚Äîonly works during sleep. Skip it = toxins accumulate."

"Fasting doesn't work because you eat less. It works because you give your metabolism time 
to switch modes. Most people never leave glucose-burning mode."

üö® NEVER DO THIS:
‚ùå "What if everything we think about X is wrong?" (hollow question)
‚ùå "Consider the possibility that..." (too vague)
‚ùå "Perhaps we should rethink..." (no substance)
‚ùå Questions without answers
