üö´ NEVER DO THIS:

‚ùå ANY fake case studies with made-up people

‚úÖ INSTEAD, DO THIS:
‚úÖ "Here's what actually happens when you..."
‚úÖ "The pattern most people miss..."
‚úÖ "Why this works for some but not others..."
‚úÖ "The mechanism behind [phenomenon]..."

TALK ABOUT PATTERNS, NOT PEOPLE:
- "Most people do X, but the data shows Y"
- "The mechanism: [explain how it works]"
- "Why timing matters more than duration"
- "The difference between X and Y that nobody talks about"

BE SPECIFIC AND INSIGHTFUL:
- Use real data and mechanisms
- Explain WHY things work
- Compare approaches
- Reveal non-obvious connections
- Sound like an expert who actually knows this stuff
