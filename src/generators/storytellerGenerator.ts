${VOICE_GUIDELINES}

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (AUTO-FAIL IF VIOLATED):
‚Ä¢ NEVER use first-person: I, me, my, mine (in ANY context)
‚Ä¢ NEVER use collective: we, us, our, ours (even "we see", "we observed")
‚Ä¢ Use third-person narrative voice ONLY (e.g., "Research documents", "Studies tracked")
‚Ä¢ Max 2 emojis total (use sparingly, prefer none)
‚Ä¢ Max 270 characters per tweet

üö® INSTANT REJECTION: "we", "us", "our", "I", "me", "my" ‚Üí Content DELETED

üö´ NEVER MAKE UP FAKE PEOPLE:
‚ùå "Sarah struggled with hormonal imbalances..."
‚ùå "A woman tried this and..."
‚ùå Generic unnamed "someone"

‚úÖ TELL REAL STORIES:
‚úÖ Documented cases: "Wim Hof summited Everest in shorts. Not genetics‚Äîtrained mitochondria."
‚úÖ Historical examples: "Navy SEALs use box breathing in combat. 4-4-4-4 pattern overrides panic response."
‚úÖ Population patterns: "Japanese centenarians eat 80% full. Stops before leptin signals satiety‚Äîdelays aging."
‚úÖ Second-person immersion: "You wake up at 3am, heart racing. Your cortisol spiked 4 hours after dinner. Here's why..."
‚úÖ Documented research subjects: "Study (n=1,200): Subjects who did X saw Y. The mechanism: Z."

WHAT MAKES STORIES INTERESTING:
- Surprising outcomes that defy expectations
- Specific numbers and measurements
- The "why" that most people miss
- Contrasts that reveal mechanisms
- Real names and real results when available

${research ? `
REAL RESEARCH TO USE:
Finding: ${research.finding}
Source: ${research.source}
Mechanism: ${research.mechanism}

Turn this into a REAL story - use the actual research subjects, actual numbers, actual outcomes.
If the research paper mentions specific results, USE THEM.

EXAMPLES OF GOOD STORYTELLING:

Bad: "Someone tried cold showers and felt better."
Good: "Wim Hof's students stayed in ice water for 80+ minutes. Control group: 12 minutes max. The difference? Brown fat activation. They weren't tolerating cold‚Äîthey were producing heat differently."

Bad: "A person changed their diet and lost weight."
Good: "Valter Longo's FMD study (2017, n=100): 5 days, dropped 8lbs. But here's what matters‚Äîvisceral fat, not total weight. The mechanism: Autophagy kicks in at 72 hours, targets damaged cells first."

Bad: "Time-restricted eating helps metabolism."
Good: "Satchin Panda's firefighters: Same calories, 10-hour eating window. Lost weight without trying. The mechanism: Circadian clock genes regulate metabolism. Eating at 11pm is like telling your liver it's noon."

BE FASCINATING:
- Use real documented examples
- Include specific numbers
- Explain the mechanism that makes it work
- Make people think "holy shit, REALLY?"
- Sound like you're sharing something genuinely interesting, not reciting a case study

${format === 'thread' ? `
OUTPUT: Return valid JSON array of 3-5 tweets (150-230 chars each):
Tweet 1: The hook - real example or surprising fact
Tweet 2: The specifics - what actually happened  
Tweet 3: The mechanism - why it worked
Tweet 4: The insight - what this reveals

REAL examples only. Make it fascinating.
Format your response as JSON.
` : `
OUTPUT: Return single tweet in JSON format (180-260 chars MAX - MUST fit in 280 chars):
Real example with mechanism - make it stop-scrolling interesting

üö® CRITICAL: Tweet MUST be under 260 characters. Count carefully.
Format your response as JSON.
