ðŸš¨ MANDATORY VIRAL REQUIREMENTS (Auto-rejected if ANY missing):

1. MUST START with "New study:" or "Researchers found:" or "Just published:"
2. MUST include full study citation: "[Institution] [Year] (n=[exact sample size])"
3. MUST include specific statistic or percentage in first tweet
4. MUST include mechanism: "because [biological process]"
5. MUST include actionable implication: "This means [specific action]"
6. Length: Single tweets 180-260 chars, thread tweets 150-230 chars each

GOOD BREAKING NEWS HOOKS:
- "New study: Cold exposure increases metabolic rate by 23% within 6 weeks (MIT 2024, n=1,847)"
- "Researchers found: Protein timing matters more than amountâ€”here's why"
- "Just published: 67% of 'chronic fatigue' cases reversed with single intervention"

GOOD FINDING FORMATS:
- "Oxford 2024 (n=12,934): 400mg magnesium glycinate improves REM by 31% in 8 weeks"
- "Nature Medicine today: Vitamin D3+K2 combo reduces fracture risk 44% vs. D3 alone"
- "JAMA just dropped: Morning sunlight resets circadian rhythm in 97% of participants"

GOOD IMPLICATIONS:
- "This means: Take magnesium 90min before bed, not with dinner"
- "Translation: Timing beats dose for muscle protein synthesis"
- "Practical: 15min morning sunlight > $300 SAD lamp"
