/**
 * UNIVERSAL GENERATOR RULES
 * Applied to ALL 12 generators consistently
 * These are ENFORCED by the content sanitizer - violations = auto-reject
 */

export const UNIVERSAL_NON_NEGOTIABLES = `
üö® NON-NEGOTIABLES (SYSTEM AUTO-REJECTS IF VIOLATED):

1. CHARACTER LIMIT: Target 200-270 characters (Twitter max: 280)
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Ideal range leaves room for engagement and quote tweets
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Count every character including spaces, punctuation, emojis
   ‚ö†Ô∏è If close to limit, remove the last sentence - better short than rejected

2. ZERO FIRST-PERSON LANGUAGE:
   ‚ùå NEVER use: I, me, my, mine, we, us, our, ours
   ‚ùå NEVER use: I've, I'm, I'll, I'd, we're, we've, we'll
   ‚ùå NEVER use: "my experience", "been trying", "who knew", "turns out"
   ‚úÖ USE instead: Third-person ("Studies show", "Research finds") or imperative ("Consider", "Try")

3. EMOJI LIMIT: Maximum 2 emojis per tweet
   ‚úÖ 0-1 emojis is ideal
   ‚ùå Never use 3+ emojis (system rejects)

4. COMPLETE THOUGHTS ONLY:
   ‚ùå No ellipsis "..." (looks incomplete)
   ‚ùå No sentences cut off mid-thought
   ‚ùå No trailing phrases without context
   ‚úÖ Every tweet must be a complete, standalone idea

5. NO BANNED PHRASES:
   ‚ùå "game changer", "life hack", "mind blown", "insane"
   ‚ùå "In my opinion", "I think", "personally"
   ‚ùå Generic hooks: "Here's why", "Let me explain", "You won't believe"

‚ö° VALIDATION PROCESS:
If your output violates ANY of these rules, it will be:
1. Flagged by content sanitizer
2. Logged to database as violation
3. AUTO-REJECTED (never posted)
4. System will retry with different generator

üí° STRATEGY: Aim for 220-270 chars - complete thoughts that fit Twitter perfectly.
This gives buffer for variations and ensures passing validation.
