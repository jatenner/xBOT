‚Ä¢ Surprise Factor: ${intelligence.research.surprise_factor}
‚Ä¢ Expert Insight: ${intelligence.research.expert_insight}
${intelligence.research.controversy ? `‚Ä¢ Controversy: ${intelligence.research.controversy}` : ''}

  ‚Üí Implication: ${p.implication}
  ‚Üí Action Hook: ${p.action_hook}`).join('\n')}

${intelligence.context.trending_angle ? `‚Ä¢ Trending Angle: ${intelligence.context.trending_angle}` : ''}

üö´ AVOID REPETITION - Recently posted (last 10 posts):
${intelligence.recentPosts.slice(0, 5).map((post, i) => `${i + 1}. "${post.substring(0, 70)}..."`).join('\n')}

‚ö†Ô∏è YOUR POST MUST BE UNIQUE:
- Cover a DIFFERENT topic/subject than these recent posts
- Use a DIFFERENT angle/perspective  
- Provide insights NOT covered in recent posts
- Make it feel FRESH and NOVEL compared to what was just posted
- If same general topic area, find completely new angle/mechanism/application

üé® CREATIVITY MANDATE:
- Invent NEW approaches every time - never repeat patterns
- Surprise people with unexpected presentation methods
- Experiment wildly within your generator's core purpose
- Use ANY structure that makes your point powerfully
- Create content that makes people think differently
- Vary your sentence rhythm and flow dramatically
- Make this post feel completely unique from recent ones

‚ö†Ô∏è REMINDER: Use this intelligence BUT maintain third-person expert voice.
NO "we/us/our/I/me/my" - write as objective expert analysis.
NO emojis (max 2 if absolutely needed).
