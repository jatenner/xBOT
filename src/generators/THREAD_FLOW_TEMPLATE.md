## ❌ WRONG: Independent Points on Same Topic

```
Tweet 1: "MYTH: Cold exposure is brave..."
Tweet 2: "Cold showers = misery? Wrong!..."
Tweet 3: "Think cold exposure is TORTURE?..."
```

**Problem:** 3 separate points, no connection, no flow

---

## ✅ RIGHT: Progressive Narrative Flow

```
Tweet 1: "MYTH: Cold exposure is just for the brave... [HOOK]"
Tweet 2: "Here's what actually happens when you hit that cold water: Your body releases norepinephrine, cortisol regulation kicks in... [MECHANISM]"
Tweet 3: "Start simple: 30 seconds cold at shower end. Build to 2 minutes over 2 weeks. Track your energy levels... [ACTION]"
```

**Solution:** Progressive story - Hook → Science → Action

---

## 📝 Required Thread Flow Patterns:

### **Pattern 1: Problem → Science → Solution**
```
1. "Most people think X is Y..." [Problem/Myth]
2. "But here's what research shows: [mechanism]..." [Science]
3. "Here's how to apply it: [steps]..." [Solution]
```

### **Pattern 2: Question → Answer → Deeper Insight**
```
1. "Why does X happen?..." [Question]
2. "The answer: [mechanism]..." [Answer]  
3. "But here's what they don't tell you: [twist]..." [Deeper layer]
```

### **Pattern 3: Claim → Evidence → Action**
```
1. "X can change Y in Z days..." [Bold claim]
2. "Study from [source] found [data]..." [Evidence]
3. "Protocol: Do X, measure Y, adjust Z..." [Actionable]
```

## 🔗 Connecting Words (MANDATORY):

**Tweet 2 must start with:**
- "Here's why:"
- "The science:"
- "What actually happens:"
- "But here's the truth:"
- "The mechanism:"

**Tweet 3 must start with:**
- "Here's how to use it:"
- "The protocol:"
- "What this means for you:"
- "The actionable part:"
- "So what should you do:"

**Tweet 4+ must start with:**
- "The results:"
- "The takeaway:"
- "One more thing:"
- "The catch:"

## 🚫 BANNED: Standalone Statements

**Don't:**
- Make each tweet a complete, independent thought
- Repeat the same point 3 different ways
- Use different hooks for each tweet
- Start each tweet with "MYTH:" or emoji without connection

**Do:**
- Build on previous tweet
- Use connecting phrases
- Progress the narrative
- Create anticipation for next tweet

## ✅ Generator Checklist

Every generator MUST include this in thread prompts:

```
🔥 THREAD FLOW RULES:
1. Tweet 1 = Hook/Setup (grab attention)
2. Tweet 2+ = Build on previous tweet using connecting words
3. Each tweet advances the narrative (don't repeat same point)
4. Final tweet = Payoff/Takeaway (what to do with this info)

MANDATORY CONNECTING PHRASES:
- "Here's why:", "The science:", "What happens:", "The catch:"
- NO standalone points!
- Threads are ONE story in parts, not separate posts!
```
