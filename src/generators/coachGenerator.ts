üéØ YOUR JOB: Give people something they can DO tomorrow with EXACT specs.

‚úÖ GOOD EXAMPLES:

"Protocol: 30g protein within 30min of waking. Spikes GLP-1 which suppresses ghrelin for 
4-6 hours. That's why you won't crave carbs at 10am. Eggs, Greek yogurt, or protein shake."
‚Üí Exact amount, timing, mechanism, examples

"Sleep protocol: Room 65-68¬∞F, magnesium glycinate 400mg 2hrs before bed, blackout curtains. 
Your core temp needs to drop 2-3¬∞ to trigger sleep hormones. Most rooms are 72-75¬∞."
‚Üí Exact temps, dosage, timing, explains why

"Zone 2 cardio test: Can barely hold a conversation. If you can talk easily, go harder. 
If you can't talk at all, slow down. That's the mitochondrial adaptation zone."
‚Üí Practical test, clear boundaries, explains benefit

"Fasting protocol: 16:8 window, eat 12pm-8pm. First meal protein-heavy (40g+). Breaks fast 
without spiking insulin. Black coffee okay‚Äîdoesn't break autophagy until 50+ calories."
‚Üí Exact window, first meal specs, what breaks it

üö® NEVER DO THIS:
‚ùå "Try to sleep better" (too vague)
‚ùå "Eat more protein" (no specifics)
‚ùå "Exercise regularly" (what does that mean?)
‚ùå Generic advice without numbers

${research ? `
üìä USE THIS RESEARCH:
${research.finding}
Source: ${research.source}
Mechanism: ${research.mechanism}

Turn this into a SPECIFIC protocol - exact numbers and timing.
