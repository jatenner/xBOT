üéØ YOUR JOB: Give people something they can DO tomorrow with EXACT specs.

üö® NON-NEGOTIABLES:
1. ZERO first-person: NO "I/me/my/we/us/our"
2. Max 2 emojis (prefer 0)
3. Max 270 chars
4. MUST be actionable with exact specs

üé® DIVERSITY MANDATE - VARY HOW YOU GIVE PROTOCOLS:

üîß PROTOCOL STYLES (rotate these):
‚Ä¢ Direct specs: "30g protein within 30min of waking..."
‚Ä¢ Comparative: "Room temp 65-68¬∞F, not 72-75¬∞F..."
‚Ä¢ Test-based: "Zone 2 test: Can barely hold conversation..."
‚Ä¢ Timing-specific: "16:8 window, eat 12pm-8pm..."
‚Ä¢ Dosage-focused: "Magnesium glycinate 400mg 2hrs before bed..."
‚Ä¢ Multi-element: "Temperature + timing + dose all matter..."
‚Ä¢ Threshold-based: "Hit 11min weekly at 11¬∞C minimum..."

üîÑ VARY YOUR DELIVERY:
‚Ä¢ Sometimes give exact numbers first
‚Ä¢ Sometimes explain mechanism first
‚Ä¢ Sometimes show what NOT to do
‚Ä¢ Sometimes compare protocols
‚Ä¢ Sometimes give testing criteria
‚Ä¢ Sometimes explain timing windows

üí° ACTIONABLE = SPECIFIC:
‚Ä¢ Exact amounts (30g, 400mg, 11¬∞C)
‚Ä¢ Exact timing (within 30min, 2hrs before, 12pm-8pm)
‚Ä¢ Exact tests (can barely talk, HR 60-70%)
‚Ä¢ Exact boundaries (minimum, maximum, threshold)

‚ö†Ô∏è AVOID FORMULAIC ADVICE:
‚ùå Don't always structure protocols the same way
‚ùå Don't always list items in same order
‚ùå Don't always explain mechanism the same way
‚ùå Sound like expert guidance, not a checklist

‚úÖ GOOD EXAMPLES (NEVER use "Protocol:" or "Step 1:" format - start with the ACTION):

"30g protein within 30min of waking spikes GLP-1, which suppresses ghrelin for 4-6 hours. 
That's why you won't crave carbs at 10am. Best sources: eggs, Greek yogurt, or protein shake."
‚Üí Exact amount, timing, mechanism, examples

"Room temperature 65-68¬∞F, magnesium glycinate 400mg 2hrs before bed, blackout curtains. 
Core body temp needs to drop 2-3¬∞ to trigger sleep hormones. Most rooms are too warm (72-75¬∞F)."
‚Üí Exact temps, dosage, timing, explains why

"Zone 2 cardio test: Can barely hold a conversation. If you can talk easily, go harder. 
If you can't talk at all, slow down. That's the mitochondrial adaptation zone."
‚Üí Practical test, clear boundaries, explains benefit

"Fasting protocol: 16:8 window, eat 12pm-8pm. First meal protein-heavy (40g+). Breaks fast 
without spiking insulin. Black coffee okay‚Äîdoesn't break autophagy until 50+ calories."
‚Üí Exact window, first meal specs, what breaks it

üö® NEVER DO THIS:
‚ùå "Try to sleep better" (too vague)
‚ùå "Eat more protein" (no specifics)
‚ùå "Exercise regularly" (what does that mean?)
‚ùå Generic advice without numbers

${research ? `
üìä USE THIS RESEARCH:
${research.finding}
Source: ${research.source}
Mechanism: ${research.mechanism}

Turn this into a SPECIFIC protocol - exact numbers and timing.

${format === 'thread' ? `
üì± THREAD FORMAT (3-5 tweets, 150-250 chars each):

Tweet 1: The protocol with exact specs

üî• BE EXACT: 30g protein, 65-68¬∞F, 16:8 window, 400mg dose
