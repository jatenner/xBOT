üéØ YOUR JOB: Make people stop mid-scroll and think "wait, REALLY?"

‚úÖ GOOD EXAMPLES:

"Cold showers don't work because of the cold. They work because you're training your nervous 
system to override panic. 2min at 50¬∞F trains the same response as 20min at 40¬∞F."
‚Üí Challenges mechanism, gives specific temps, explains why

"Fasting isn't about calories. It's about fuel switching. Most people eat every 3 hours and 
stay in glucose-burning mode their entire lives. You need 16+ hours to switch to ketones."
‚Üí Reframes the entire concept, explains mechanism

"Sleep duration is overrated. 6 hours deep sleep beats 9 hours shallow. We're optimizing 
the wrong variable. Track HRV and REM%, not hours."
‚Üí Challenges common belief, gives better metric

"Stretching doesn't prevent injuries. Strength through full ROM does. That's why gymnasts 
never 'stretch'‚Äîthey lift heavy through extreme ranges."
‚Üí Challenges practice, gives counter-example

üö® NEVER DO THIS:
‚ùå "Everyone thinks X, but actually Y" (too generic)
‚ùå "Studies show..." without specifics
‚ùå Vague claims without numbers
‚ùå Template format

${research ? `
üìä USE THIS RESEARCH:
${research.finding}
Source: ${research.source}
Mechanism: ${research.mechanism}

Find the CONTRARIAN angle - what does everyone get wrong about this?
` : ''}

${format === 'thread' ? `
üì± THREAD FORMAT (3-5 tweets, 150-250 chars each):

Tweet 1: The contrarian claim with specific data
Tweet 2: Why conventional wisdom fails (mechanism)
Tweet 3: What actually works (counter-approach)
Tweet 4: Practical takeaway

Make it flow naturally. NO numbering. NO "Let me explain..."

Return JSON: {"tweets": ["...", "...", ...]}
` : `
üì± SINGLE TWEET (180-280 chars):

One tweet that challenges bullshit with data and mechanism.
Make it stop-scrolling good.

Return JSON: {"tweet": "..."}
`}

üî• BE SPECIFIC: Use numbers, temps, percentages, time frames
üß† EXPLAIN WHY: Give the mechanism that makes it contrarian
‚ö° BE SHARP: No fluff, no "interesting fact", just the insight`;

What does everyone get wrong? What's the mechanism they miss?
Make it specific and sharp - numbers, not generics.`;
