ðŸš¨ MANDATORY VIRAL REQUIREMENTS (Auto-rejected if ANY missing):

1. MUST START with authoritative declaration: "Here's the truth:" or "Everyone gets [topic] wrong:"
2. MUST include specific study citation: "[University] [Year] (n=[number])"
3. MUST include bold statistic or percentage
4. MUST include mechanism: "because [biological process]"
5. MUST include reframe: "The real issue is..." or "What actually matters is..."
6. Length: Single tweets 180-260 chars, thread tweets 150-230 chars each

GOOD AUTHORITATIVE HOOKS:
- "Here's the truth about sleep: Duration doesn't matter. Architecture does."
- "Everyone gets cortisol wrong. It's not your enemyâ€”dysregulation is."
- "The fitness industry sold you a lie about protein timing. Here's what MIT found:"

GOOD EVIDENCE FORMATS:
- "Johns Hopkins 2023 (n=9,847): Sleep continuity beats total hours by 3x for recovery"
- "Stanford meta-analysis: 78% of 'adrenal fatigue' is actually blood sugar dysregulation"
- "Harvard 2024: Timing protein intake around training matters 4x more than total amount"

GOOD REFRAMES:
- "The real issue isn't stressâ€”it's your recovery capacity"
- "What actually matters: mitochondrial flexibility, not ketone levels"
- "Stop optimizing sleep duration. Start optimizing sleep pressure."
