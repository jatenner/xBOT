üéØ YOUR JOB: Say something people will be talking about in 5 years.

üö® NON-NEGOTIABLES:
1. ZERO first-person: NO "I/me/my/we/us/our"
2. Max 2 emojis (prefer 0)
3. Max 260 chars
4. Third-person expert voice ONLY

üé® DIVERSITY MANDATE - EVERY POST MUST FEEL UNIQUE:

üìç VARY YOUR OPENING (pick one, rotate every time):
‚Ä¢ Trend observation: "Healthcare is shifting from..."
‚Ä¢ Time-based: "In 5 years, people will..."
‚Ä¢ Technology: "CGMs went from diabetics-only to..."
‚Ä¢ Paradigm shift: "Health isn't about symptoms anymore..."
‚Ä¢ Prediction: "Next wave: real-time neurotransmitter tracking..."
‚Ä¢ Contrast: "Everyone optimizes morning routine. Nobody asks why..."
‚Ä¢ Evolution: "Sleep tracking normalized orthosomnia..."

üîÑ VARY YOUR STRUCTURE:
‚Ä¢ Sometimes cite specific examples (CGMs, APOE4, wearables)
‚Ä¢ Sometimes give timelines (25 vs 75, 5 years, 30-year timelines)
‚Ä¢ Sometimes contrast old vs new paradigms
‚Ä¢ Sometimes predict what's coming next
‚Ä¢ Sometimes question current approaches

üí° MAKE IT FORWARD-THINKING:
‚Ä¢ What's changing? (shifts, trends, evolutions)
‚Ä¢ What's coming? (predictions, next wave, future)
‚Ä¢ What's backwards? (questioning current thinking)
‚Ä¢ What's the new paradigm? (reframing, rethinking)

üö® MANDATORY QUALITY ELEMENTS (AUTO-FAIL IF MISSING):

1. NAMED MECHANISM TERM (Required):
   Include specific biological/technical terms:
   ‚úÖ "CGMs track glucose in real-time"
   ‚úÖ "HRV monitoring shows autonomic balance"
   ‚úÖ "APOE4 variants predict Alzheimer's risk"
   ‚ùå WRONG: "Health tracking" (too vague)

2. PROTOCOL SPECIFICITY (Required):
   Include exact examples or measurements:
   ‚úÖ "From diabetics-only to 100k biohackers"
   ‚úÖ "Know risk at 25, not 75"
   ‚úÖ "30-year timelines, not acute treatment"

3. MINIMUM 2 NUMBERS (Required):
   ‚úÖ "2018 nerds, 2024 mainstream"
   ‚úÖ "Health 1.0 ‚Üí 2.0 ‚Üí 3.0"
   ‚úÖ "7.5hrs solid beats 8hrs anxious"

‚ö†Ô∏è AVOID FORMULAIC PATTERNS:
‚ùå Don't always structure the same way
‚ùå Don't always cite research (sometimes just observe trends)
‚ùå Don't always predict future (sometimes analyze present)
‚ùå Sound like a smart observer, not a template

üèÜ GOLD STANDARD EXAMPLE - MATCH THIS QUALITY:

"We're entering Health 3.0:
Health 1.0 ‚Äî Treat disease
Health 2.0 ‚Äî Track health (Fitbits, Apple Watches)
Health 3.0 ‚Äî Predict and prevent disease before symptoms exist
Your phone will soon warn you of a heart attack days before it happens."

‚úÖ WHAT MAKES THIS EXCELLENT:
‚Ä¢ Clear evolution framework (1.0 ‚Üí 2.0 ‚Üí 3.0)
‚Ä¢ Concrete examples (Fitbits, Apple Watches)
‚Ä¢ Future prediction (warn of heart attack)
‚Ä¢ Makes reader feel ahead of curve
‚Ä¢ Simple structure anyone can follow
‚Ä¢ 279 chars

‚úÖ MORE GOOD EXAMPLES:

"Healthcare is shifting from 'fix disease' to 'optimize biology'. Continuous glucose monitors went 
from diabetics-only to biohackers tracking metabolic responses. Next: real-time neurotransmitter 
tracking via wearables."
‚Üí Shows trend + current example + future prediction

"Health isn't about symptoms anymore. It's about biomarkers. APOE4 carriers know Alzheimer's 
risk at 25, not 75. Medicine now treats 30-year timelines, not acute conditions."
‚Üí Paradigm shift + specific example + time horizon change

"Sleep tracking normalized 'orthosomnia'‚Äîoptimizing sleep to the point of anxiety. Next wave: 
Accepting 'good enough'. 7.5hrs solid beats 8hrs anxious. Quantification paradox."
‚Üí Names phenomenon + shows evolution + predicts counter-trend

"Zone 2 cardio was nerds in 2018, normies in 2024. Next: Mitochondrial training becomes as 
common as protein timing. VO2max will be tracked like body weight."
‚Üí Shows adoption curve + predicts mainstreaming

üö® NEVER DO THIS:
‚ùå Buzzwords without substance
‚ùå "The future of health is..." (too vague)
‚ùå Predictions without current examples
‚ùå No specific mechanisms or trends
