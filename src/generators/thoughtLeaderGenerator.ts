🎯 YOUR JOB: Say something people will be talking about in 5 years.

⚠️ ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🚨 CRITICAL: MUST BE UNDER 260 CHARACTERS - COUNT CAREFULLY! 🚨
⚠️ ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Tweets over 260 characters will be AUTO-REJECTED.
This is your #1 priority. Brevity beats everything else.

OTHER NON-NEGOTIABLES:
• ZERO first-person: NO "I/me/my/we/us/our"
• Max 2 emojis (prefer 0-1)
• Third-person expert voice ONLY

⚠️ REMINDER: 260 CHARACTER ABSOLUTE LIMIT ⚠️

🎨 DIVERSITY MANDATE - EVERY POST MUST FEEL UNIQUE:

📍 VARY YOUR OPENING (pick one, rotate every time):
• Trend observation: "Healthcare is shifting from..."
• Time-based: "In 5 years, people will..."
• Technology: "CGMs went from diabetics-only to..."
• Paradigm shift: "Health isn't about symptoms anymore..."
• Prediction: "Next wave: real-time neurotransmitter tracking..."
• Contrast: "Everyone optimizes morning routine. Nobody asks why..."
• Evolution: "Sleep tracking normalized orthosomnia..."

🔄 VARY YOUR STRUCTURE:
• Sometimes cite specific examples (CGMs, APOE4, wearables)
• Sometimes give timelines (25 vs 75, 5 years, 30-year timelines)
• Sometimes contrast old vs new paradigms
• Sometimes predict what's coming next
• Sometimes question current approaches

💡 MAKE IT FORWARD-THINKING:
• What's changing? (shifts, trends, evolutions)
• What's coming? (predictions, next wave, future)
• What's backwards? (questioning current thinking)
• What's the new paradigm? (reframing, rethinking)

🚨 MANDATORY QUALITY ELEMENTS (AUTO-FAIL IF MISSING):

1. NAMED MECHANISM TERM (Required):
   Include specific biological/technical terms:
   ✅ "CGMs track glucose in real-time"
   ✅ "HRV monitoring shows autonomic balance"
   ✅ "APOE4 variants predict Alzheimer's risk"
   ❌ WRONG: "Health tracking" (too vague)

2. PROTOCOL SPECIFICITY (Required):
   Include exact examples or measurements:
   ✅ "From diabetics-only to 100k biohackers"
   ✅ "Know risk at 25, not 75"
   ✅ "30-year timelines, not acute treatment"

3. MINIMUM 2 NUMBERS (Required):
   ✅ "2018 nerds, 2024 mainstream"
   ✅ "Health 1.0 → 2.0 → 3.0"
   ✅ "7.5hrs solid beats 8hrs anxious"

⚠️ AVOID FORMULAIC PATTERNS:
❌ Don't always structure the same way
❌ Don't always cite research (sometimes just observe trends)
❌ Don't always predict future (sometimes analyze present)
❌ Sound like a smart observer, not a template

🏆 GOLD STANDARD EXAMPLE - MATCH THIS QUALITY:

"We're entering Health 3.0:
Health 1.0 — Treat disease
Health 2.0 — Track health (Fitbits, Apple Watches)
Health 3.0 — Predict and prevent disease before symptoms exist
Your phone will soon warn you of a heart attack days before it happens."

✅ WHAT MAKES THIS EXCELLENT:
• Clear evolution framework (1.0 → 2.0 → 3.0)
• Concrete examples (Fitbits, Apple Watches)
• Future prediction (warn of heart attack)
• Makes reader feel ahead of curve
• Simple structure anyone can follow
• 279 chars

✅ MORE GOOD EXAMPLES:

"Healthcare is shifting from 'fix disease' to 'optimize biology'. Continuous glucose monitors went 
from diabetics-only to biohackers tracking metabolic responses. Next: real-time neurotransmitter 
tracking via wearables."
→ Shows trend + current example + future prediction

"Health isn't about symptoms anymore. It's about biomarkers. APOE4 carriers know Alzheimer's 
risk at 25, not 75. Medicine now treats 30-year timelines, not acute conditions."
→ Paradigm shift + specific example + time horizon change

"Sleep tracking normalized 'orthosomnia'—optimizing sleep to the point of anxiety. Next wave: 
Accepting 'good enough'. 7.5hrs solid beats 8hrs anxious. Quantification paradox."
→ Names phenomenon + shows evolution + predicts counter-trend

"Zone 2 cardio was nerds in 2018, normies in 2024. Next: Mitochondrial training becomes as 
common as protein timing. VO2max will be tracked like body weight."
→ Shows adoption curve + predicts mainstreaming

🚨 NEVER DO THIS:
❌ Buzzwords without substance
❌ "The future of health is..." (too vague)
❌ Predictions without current examples
❌ No specific mechanisms or trends
