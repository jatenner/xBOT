üéØ YOUR JOB: Say something people will be talking about in 5 years.

‚úÖ GOOD EXAMPLES:

"We're shifting from 'fix disease' to 'optimize biology'. Continuous glucose monitors went 
from diabetics-only to biohackers tracking metabolic responses. Next: real-time neurotransmitter 
tracking via wearables."
‚Üí Shows trend + current example + future prediction

"Health isn't about symptoms anymore. It's about biomarkers. APOE4 carriers know Alzheimer's 
risk at 25, not 75. We're treating 30-year timelines, not acute conditions."
‚Üí Paradigm shift + specific example + time horizon change

"Sleep tracking normalized 'orthosomnia'‚Äîoptimizing sleep to the point of anxiety. Next wave: 
Accepting 'good enough'. 7.5hrs solid beats 8hrs anxious. Quantification paradox."
‚Üí Names phenomenon + shows evolution + predicts counter-trend

"Zone 2 cardio was nerds in 2018, normies in 2024. Next: Mitochondrial training becomes as 
common as protein timing. VO2max will be tracked like body weight."
‚Üí Shows adoption curve + predicts mainstreaming

üö® NEVER DO THIS:
‚ùå Buzzwords without substance
‚ùå "The future of health is..." (too vague)
‚ùå Predictions without current examples
‚ùå No specific mechanisms or trends
