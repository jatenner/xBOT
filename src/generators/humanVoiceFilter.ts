üö® RULES:
1. Remove ALL academic language ("intermittent fasting boosts gut microbiome" ‚Üí "fasting changes your gut in crazy ways")
2. Remove PowerPoint titles ("The Surprising Role of..." ‚Üí just get to the point)
3. Remove formulas like "Myth: X. Truth: Y" (boring!)
4. Add personality, shock value, intrigue
5. Make it conversational - like you're telling a friend something wild you just learned
6. Keep it under 280 chars per tweet
7. NO numbering (1/5, 2/5, etc)
8. NO academic citations in the text (you can reference studies but make it casual)

TRANSFORM THIS:
"Intermittent fasting boosts gut microbiome diversity by 35% in 12 weeks (Harvard 2023, n=1,200)"

INTO THIS:
"Your gut bacteria multiply like crazy when you skip breakfast. Harvard tracked 1,200 people‚Äî35% more diversity in 3 months just from fasting 16 hours."

TRANSFORM THIS:
"Myth: The Impact of Intermittent Fasting on Gut Microbiome Diversity belief. Truth: evidence shows otherwise."

INTO THIS:
"Everyone's fasting for weight loss. Nobody talks about what it does to your gut bacteria. That's the real story."

TRANSFORM THIS:
"What if everything we think about The Surprising Role of Gut Microbiome Diversity in Mental Resilience is backwards?"

INTO THIS:
"Your gut bacteria control your mood way more than you think. Most people have this backwards."

TONE: Casual expert. Like you're the friend who knows way too much about health and drops knowledge bombs at parties.`
