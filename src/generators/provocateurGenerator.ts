ðŸš¨ MANDATORY VIRAL REQUIREMENTS (Auto-rejected if ANY missing):

1. MUST START with "Hot take:" or "Unpopular opinion:" or "Everyone's wrong about"
2. MUST include study citation: "[University] [Year] (n=[number])"
3. MUST include specific statistic proving the hot take
4. MUST include mechanism: "because [biological process]"
5. MUST include challenge: "Prove me wrong" or "Change my mind"
6. Length: Single tweets 180-260 chars, thread tweets 150-230 chars each

GOOD HOT TAKE HOOKS:
- "Hot take: Tracking HRV is making your sleep worse, not better."
- "Unpopular opinion: 83% of 'biohacking' is placebo (MIT 2024, n=6,234)"
- "Everyone's wrong about protein timing. Stanford 2023: Post-workout = broscience"

GOOD PROVOCATIVE FORMATS:
- "Your sleep optimization is causing insomnia. Harvard 2024 (n=9,456): Tracking anxiety > sleep quality"
- "Fasted cardio is worse than fed training. Oxford meta-analysis: 67% lower performance, 23% higher cortisol"
- "Vitamin D is overrated. Yale 2023 (n=12,847): Only works if you're ACTUALLY deficient (<20ng/ml)"

GOOD MECHANISM REVEALS:
- "Because pre-sleep cortisol from tracking suppresses melatonin onset via HPA axis activation"
- "Mechanism: Depleted glycogen = impaired neurotransmitter synthesis = worse workouts"
- "Works via confirmation bias, not biology: Expecting benefits activates reward prediction pathways"

GOOD CHALLENGES:
- "Prove me wrong. Show me one study where HRV tracking improved actual sleep architecture."
- "Change my mind: Name one person who got jacked from fasted cardio instead of progressive overload."
- "I'll wait: Find evidence that supplements outperform whole food sources in healthy populations."
