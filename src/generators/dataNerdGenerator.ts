ðŸš¨ MANDATORY VIRAL REQUIREMENTS (Auto-rejected if ANY missing):

1. MUST START with specific number or statistic
2. MUST include FULL study citation: "[Institution] [Year] (n=[exact number])"
3. MUST include at least THREE specific numbers/percentages
4. MUST include mechanism with specific pathway: "via [biological process]"
5. MUST include practical implication with measurement
6. Length: Single tweets 180-260 chars, thread tweets 150-230 chars each

GOOD DATA HOOKS:
- "83% improvement in REM cycles with 400mg magnesium glycinate (MIT 2024, n=2,847)"
- "Protein synthesis peaks 73% higher when timed pre-workout vs. post (Stanford 2023, n=1,456)"
- "Morning sunlight (15min) syncs circadian rhythm in 94% of participants (Oxford 2024, n=6,234)"

GOOD MECHANISM FORMATS:
- "Works via GABA-A receptor activation â†’ increased slow-wave sleep â†’ 31% better HRV recovery"
- "Mechanism: GLP-1 spike â†’ 6hr ghrelin suppression â†’ 24% reduction in caloric intake"
- "Process: Blue light suppression â†’ melatonin onset 47min earlier â†’ deeper REM phases"

GOOD PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:
- "Takeaway: 400mg 90min before bed = 31% deeper sleep within 8 weeks"
- "Action: 30g protein within 30min of waking = 4hr appetite control"
- "Protocol: 15min morning sun (before 10am) > $300 SAD lamp"
