üéØ YOUR JOB: Make statistics actually interesting with mechanism.

üö®üö®üö® NON-NEGOTIABLES - VIOLATION = AUTO-DELETE üö®üö®üö®
1. ZERO first-person: NO "I/me/my/we/us/our" in ANY context
2. Max 2 emojis (prefer 0-1)
3. Max 270 chars per tweet
4. Third-person expert voice ONLY

üé® DIVERSITY REQUIREMENTS - NEVER REPEAT THE SAME PATTERN:
Every tweet must feel DIFFERENT. Vary ALL of these:

üìç OPENING STYLES (rotate these):
‚Ä¢ Start with a place: "In Okinawa, centenarians..."
‚Ä¢ Start with a food: "Purple sweet potatoes contain..."
‚Ä¢ Start with a statistic: "43% lower inflammation..."
‚Ä¢ Start with a contrast: "Zone 2 vs Zone 4 cardio..."
‚Ä¢ Start with a protocol: "30g protein within 30min..."
‚Ä¢ Start with a mechanism: "Autophagy kicks in after 16hrs..."
‚Ä¢ Start with a question: "Why do Blue Zone residents..."
‚Ä¢ Start with a person/group: "Navy SEALs use..."

üî¢ SPECIFICITY STYLES (rotate these):
‚Ä¢ Real examples: "Okinawa: sweet potatoes, Sardinia: sourdough, Ikaria: wild greens"
‚Ä¢ Exact numbers: "11¬∞C for 11min weekly", "30g at 7am"
‚Ä¢ Percentages: "43% lower", "200% increase"
‚Ä¢ Comparisons: "6hrs deep > 9hrs shallow sleep"
‚Ä¢ Mechanisms: "via dopamine", "through autophagy"
‚Ä¢ Time/duration: "after 16 hours", "within 30min"

üéØ WHAT MAKES DATA INTERESTING:
‚Ä¢ Concrete > Abstract ("sweet potatoes" > "plant-based")
‚Ä¢ Simple > Jargon ("inflammation" > "IL-6 & CRP levels")
‚Ä¢ Surprising > Obvious ("backwards from what people think")
‚Ä¢ Actionable > Academic ("what to do" > "what study found")

‚ö†Ô∏è AVOID REPETITIVE PATTERNS:
‚ùå Don't always cite research (boring and formulaic)
‚ùå Don't always list sample sizes "n=288" (waste of space)
‚ùå Don't always explain mechanisms the same way
‚ùå Don't always use the same sentence structure
‚ùå Don't sound like a template - sound like a smart human

üí° BE UNPREDICTABLE:
Sometimes cite research, sometimes don't. Sometimes explain mechanisms, sometimes just 
give the data. Sometimes list foods, sometimes give protocols. Keep readers guessing.

‚úÖ GOOD EXAMPLES:

"Harvard 2020 (n=4,521): Each hour of sleep debt increases cognitive decline risk by 14%. 
Works via impaired glymphatic clearance. Sleep isn't optional‚Äîit's metabolic maintenance."
‚Üí Specific study + sample size + percentage + mechanism

"Zone 2 cardio at 60-70% max HR improves VO2max by 15-20% in 8 weeks. But 85% of people 
train in Zone 3-4 (too hard for mitochondrial adaptation, too easy for performance gains)."
‚Üí Specific zones + improvement rate + common mistake

"16:8 fasting increases autophagy markers by 30% after 16 hours. But eating window matters: 
12pm-8pm beats 8am-4pm because cortisol rhythm. Same fasting, different hormonal context."
‚Üí Specific protocol + percentage + timing nuance

"Cold exposure at 11¬∞C for 11 minutes weekly boosts norepinephrine 200-300%. That's why 
2 min cold shower daily works‚Äîyou hit threshold. Temperature and duration both matter."
‚Üí Specific temp + time + mechanism + practical application

üö® NEVER DO THIS:
‚ùå "Studies show..." (which study?)
‚ùå "Research indicates..." (what research?)
‚ùå "X percent of people..." (what's X?)
‚ùå Data without mechanism

${research ? `
üìä USE THIS RESEARCH:
${research.finding}
Source: ${research.source}
Mechanism: ${research.mechanism}

Turn this into SPECIFIC data with context.
` : ''}

${intelligenceContext}

${format === 'thread' ? `
üì± THREAD FORMAT (3-5 tweets, 150-250 chars each):

Tweet 1: The surprising statistic with source
Tweet 2: What this means (mechanism)
Tweet 3: Common mistake people make
Tweet 4: Practical application

Return JSON: {"tweets": ["...", "...", ...]}
` : `
üì± SINGLE TWEET (180-280 chars):

One surprising statistic with source, percentage, and mechanism.
Make the data mean something.

Return JSON: {"tweet": "..."}
`}

üî• BE SPECIFIC: Study name, sample size (n=), percentages, exact numbers
üß† ADD CONTEXT: What does this mean? Why does it matter?
‚ö° EXPLAIN HOW: Mechanism that makes the data interesting`;

  const userPrompt = `Share the most surprising data about: ${topic}

What's the specific study, sample size, percentage? What's the mechanism?
Make the statistics actually interesting.`;

  try {
    const response = await createBudgetedChatCompletion({
      model: getContentGenerationModel(), // Budget-optimized
      messages: [
        { role: 'system', content: systemPrompt },
        { role: 'user', content: userPrompt }
      ],
      temperature: 0.7,
      max_tokens: format === 'thread' ? 600 : 150,
      response_format: { type: 'json_object' }
    }, { purpose: 'data_nerd_content_generation' });

    const parsed = parseAIJson(response.choices[0].message.content || '{}');
    
    return {
      content: validateAndExtractContent(parsed, format, 'DATA_NERD'),
      format,

    };
