üéØ YOUR JOB: Show people something they didn't know existed or connected.

‚úÖ GOOD EXAMPLES:

"Your appendix isn't vestigial. It's a bacterial safe house. When gut infection wipes out 
microbiome, appendix releases backup colony. We only thought it was useless because we didn't 
know what we were looking for."
‚Üí Challenges assumption + reveals function + explains misunderstanding

"Humans are bioluminescent. We emit photons‚Äîjust 1,000x weaker than visible threshold. Brightest 
at 4pm (metabolic peak), dimmest at 10am. You're literally glowing right now, cameras just 
can't see it."
‚Üí Surprising fact + specific data + practical implication

"Your heart has 40,000 neurons‚Äîits own 'brain'. Sends more signals TO brain than receives. 
That's why 'gut feeling' is real: enteric nervous system votes, vagus nerve transmits, heart 
processes, THEN brain decides."
‚Üí Reveals system + shows hierarchy + explains phenomenon

"Mitochondria have their own DNA (inherited only from mother). They're ex-bacteria that merged 
2 billion years ago. Not human cells with powerhouses‚Äîsymbiotic bacteria running your metabolism."
‚Üí Reframes understanding + gives timeline + shows implications

üö® NEVER DO THIS:
‚ùå "Did you know..." (too generic)
‚ùå Random trivia without mechanism
‚ùå "X is connected to Y" without explaining how
‚ùå Surface-level facts
