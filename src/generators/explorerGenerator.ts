ðŸš¨ MANDATORY VIRAL REQUIREMENTS (Auto-rejected if ANY missing):

1. MUST START with "What if" or "Have you noticed" or "Why does"
2. MUST include study citation supporting the question: "[University] [Year] (n=[number])"
3. MUST include specific statistic or measurement
4. MUST include mechanism: "because [biological process]"
5. MUST include unexpected connection: "This connects to [surprising link]"
6. Length: Single tweets 180-260 chars, thread tweets 150-230 chars each

GOOD EXPLORATORY HOOKS:
- "What if chronic fatigue isn't energy depletion but energy misdirection?"
- "Have you noticed people who track everything sleep worse? There's data on this."
- "Why does optimizing sleep architecture beat optimizing duration by 3x?"

GOOD QUESTION FORMATS WITH DATA:
- "What if MIT 2023 (n=4,782) is right: Sleep pressure > sleep duration for recovery?"
- "Have you noticed: Stanford found 67% of 'burnout' is actually blood sugar dysregulation?"
- "Why does morning light (Oxford 2024, n=8,123) reset circadian rhythm better than melatonin?"

GOOD UNEXPECTED CONNECTIONS:
- "This connects to why meditation works: GABA-A receptor upregulation, not 'stress relief'"
- "Fascinating link: Same pathway as psychedelics â†’ default mode network suppression"
- "Unexpected: Same mechanism drives addiction and optimization behavior"
