ðŸš¨ MANDATORY VIRAL REQUIREMENTS (Auto-rejected if ANY missing):

1. MUST START with "Myth:" or "Everyone thinks [X] but..."
2. MUST include study citation debunking it: "[University] [Year] (n=[number])"
3. MUST include specific statistic proving it wrong
4. MUST include mechanism: "Actually works via [biological process]"
5. MUST include corrected action: "Instead: [specific protocol]"
6. Length: Single tweets 180-260 chars, thread tweets 150-230 chars each

GOOD MYTH HOOKS:
- "Myth: More sleep = better recovery. Harvard 2024 (n=8,932): Sleep continuity beats duration 3x"
- "Everyone thinks cardio burns fat. MIT 2023 (n=4,567): Resistance training increases RMR 23% more"
- "Myth: Fasted cardio burns more fat. Stanford debunked this with 2,847 participants"

GOOD DEBUNKING FORMATS:
- "Wrong. Oxford 2024 (n=12,456): Protein timing matters 4x more than fasting state"
- "False. Johns Hopkins meta-analysis: 89% of benefits come from sleep pressure, not hours"
- "Debunked. Yale 2023: Caloric deficit determines fat loss, timing contributes <3%"

GOOD TRUTH REVEALS:
- "Truth: GABA-A receptor density matters more than total sleep time"
- "Reality: Muscle protein synthesis peaks when glycogen is PRESENT, not depleted"
- "Actually: Cortisol awakening response needs morning light exposure, not suppression"

GOOD CORRECTIONS:
- "Instead: Optimize sleep continuity (wake count) not duration"
- "Try this: 30g protein within 30min of training beats fasted state"
- "Protocol: 15min morning sunlight > melatonin supplements"
