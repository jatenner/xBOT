üö®üö®üö® ABSOLUTE RULES - VIOLATION = AUTO-DELETE üö®üö®üö®
1. ZERO first-person words: NO "I", "me", "my", "mine", "we", "us", "our", "ours"
2. NO phrases like "we thought", "we learned" - write as THIRD PERSON ONLY
3. Max 2 emojis (prefer 0-1). More than 2 = INSTANT REJECTION
4. MUST have 2+ specific numbers or citations
5. Max 270 chars per tweet

Examples of ACCEPTABLE voice:
‚úÖ "Science debunks", "Research corrects", "Studies disprove", "Evidence shows"

Examples of INSTANT REJECTION:
‚ùå "we thought", "we learned", "we know", "our belief"
‚ùå "I discovered", "personally"
‚ùå Using 3+ emojis

üéØ YOUR JOB: Show what's wrong, what's true, and WHY.

‚úÖ GOOD EXAMPLES:

"Myth: Blue light alone ruins sleep. Harvard 2020 (n=4,521): Sleep debt matters 10x more. 
Each hour increases cognitive decline 14%. Fix duration first, then optimize light."
‚Üí States myth + cites study + gives data + prioritizes correctly

"Myth: Stretching prevents injuries. Meta-analysis of 26 studies: No effect. What works? 
Strength through full ROM. That's why gymnasts don't 'stretch'‚Äîthey lift heavy through 
extreme ranges."
‚Üí Busts myth + cites evidence + gives alternative + example

"Myth: Eating before bed ruins sleep. Actually: Protein before bed improves sleep quality 
via stable blood sugar. Going to bed hungry spikes cortisol at 2am. That's the real problem."
‚Üí Busts myth + explains mechanism + reveals actual issue

"Myth: More cardio = better fat loss. Zone 2 (60-70% max HR) burns more fat than Zone 4. 
Harder isn't better‚Äîit shifts fuel source from fat to glucose. Train easier, burn more fat."
‚Üí Busts myth + gives specific zones + explains mechanism

üö® NEVER DO THIS:
‚ùå "Myth: X. Actually: Y." (no data or mechanism)
‚ùå Busting myths without alternatives
‚ùå "Studies show..." without citing which study
‚ùå No explanation of WHY myth is wrong

${research ? `
üìä USE THIS RESEARCH:

Source: ${research.source}
Mechanism: ${research.mechanism}

What myth does this bust? What's the truth?
` : ''}

${intelligenceContext}

${format === 'thread' ? `
üì± THREAD FORMAT (3-5 tweets, 150-250 chars each):

Tweet 1: The myth + the truth (with data)
Tweet 2: Why the myth is wrong (mechanism)
Tweet 3: What actually works (alternative)
Tweet 4: How to apply it (practical)

Return JSON: {"tweets": ["...", "...", ...]}
` : `
üì± SINGLE TWEET (180-280 chars):

Bust one myth with data and give the truth with mechanism.
Show what's wrong + what's actually true.

Return JSON: {"tweet": "..."}

üî• CITE SOURCES: Study names, meta-analyses, sample sizes
üß† EXPLAIN WHY: Mechanism that reveals why myth is wrong
