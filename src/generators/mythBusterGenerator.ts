üö® NON-NEGOTIABLES:
1. ZERO first-person: NO "I/me/my/we/us/our"
2. Max 2 emojis (prefer 0)
3. Max 270 chars
4. MUST debunk with evidence

üé® DIVERSITY MANDATE - VARY HOW YOU BUST MYTHS:

üí• MYTH-BUSTING STYLES (rotate these):
‚Ä¢ Direct contradiction: "Myth: X. Truth: Y because..."
‚Ä¢ Research reveal: "Meta-analysis of 26 studies: X doesn't work..."
‚Ä¢ Hidden mechanism: "Myth: X ruins Y. Actually: Z is the real cause..."
‚Ä¢ Priority correction: "Myth: X matters most. Data shows: Y matters 10x more..."
‚Ä¢ Alternative solution: "X doesn't work. What does? Y..."
‚Ä¢ Surprising truth: "Everyone thinks X. Science shows opposite..."
‚Ä¢ Mechanism explanation: "X works, but not why you think..."

üîÑ VARY YOUR APPROACH:
‚Ä¢ Sometimes give myth first, then truth
‚Ä¢ Sometimes lead with the data
‚Ä¢ Sometimes explain mechanism
‚Ä¢ Sometimes offer alternative
‚Ä¢ Sometimes cite multiple studies
‚Ä¢ Sometimes use comparisons

üí° WHAT MAKES MYTH-BUSTING POWERFUL:
‚Ä¢ Clear contrast (myth vs reality)
‚Ä¢ Evidence backing (studies, data, mechanisms)
‚Ä¢ Alternative offered (not just "X is wrong")
‚Ä¢ Explanation of WHY myth persists

‚ö†Ô∏è AVOID FORMULAIC DEBUNKING:
‚ùå Don't always start with "Myth:"
‚ùå Don't always structure same way
‚ùå Don't always cite research
‚ùå Sound enlightening, not repetitive

üéØ YOUR JOB: Show what's wrong, what's true, and WHY.

‚úÖ GOOD EXAMPLES:

"Myth: Blue light ruins sleep. Harvard research on 4,500 people found sleep debt matters 10x more. 
Each hour lost increases cognitive decline 14%. Fix duration first, screens second."
‚Üí States myth + gives data + prioritizes correctly + actionable

"Myth: Stretching prevents injuries. Meta-analysis of 26 studies: No effect. What works? 
Strength through full ROM. That's why gymnasts don't 'stretch'‚Äîthey lift heavy through 
extreme ranges."
‚Üí Busts myth + cites evidence + gives alternative + example

"Myth: Eating before bed ruins sleep. Actually: Protein before bed improves sleep quality 
via stable blood sugar. Going to bed hungry spikes cortisol at 2am. That's the real problem."
‚Üí Busts myth + explains mechanism + reveals actual issue

"Myth: More cardio = better fat loss. Zone 2 (60-70% max HR) burns more fat than Zone 4. 
Harder isn't better‚Äîit shifts fuel source from fat to glucose. Train easier, burn more fat."
‚Üí Busts myth + gives specific zones + explains mechanism

üö® NEVER DO THIS:
‚ùå "Myth: X. Actually: Y." (no data or mechanism)
‚ùå Busting myths without alternatives
‚ùå "Studies show..." without citing which study
‚ùå No explanation of WHY myth is wrong

üìä USE THIS RESEARCH:

What myth does this bust? What's the truth?
` : ''}

${intelligenceContext}

${format === 'thread' ? `
üì± THREAD FORMAT (3-5 tweets, 150-250 chars each):

Tweet 1: The myth + the truth (with data)
Tweet 2: Why the myth is wrong (mechanism)
Tweet 3: What actually works (alternative)
Tweet 4: How to apply it (practical)

Return JSON: {"tweets": ["...", "...", ...]}

üì± SINGLE TWEET (180-280 chars):

Bust one myth with data and give the truth with mechanism.
Show what's wrong + what's actually true.

Return JSON: {"tweet": "..."}

üî• CITE SOURCES: Study names, meta-analyses, sample sizes
üß† EXPLAIN WHY: Mechanism that reveals why myth is wrong
‚ö° GIVE ALTERNATIVE: Don't just bust‚Äîshow what works`;
