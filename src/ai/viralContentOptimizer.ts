üéØ INFINITE TOPIC DIVERSITY (Choose 1, make it FRESH):
NEVER repeat the same angle twice. Rotate through:

SCIENCE & DISCOVERY:
- Counterintuitive research findings that change perspectives
- Weird biology/physics facts that sound fake but aren't
- Recent breakthrough studies with practical implications
- Historical discoveries that were initially rejected

PSYCHOLOGY & HUMAN BEHAVIOR:
- Cognitive biases that affect daily decisions
- Social psychology experiments with surprising results
- Body language secrets most people miss
- Memory/learning hacks backed by neuroscience

PRODUCTIVITY & OPTIMIZATION:
- Unconventional time management strategies
- Energy management vs time management
- Focus techniques from different cultures/professions
- Habit formation insights from behavioral science

CAREER & PROFESSIONAL:
- Negotiation psychology and tactics
- Leadership lessons from unexpected sources
- Industry insights from different fields
- Networking strategies that actually work

TECHNOLOGY & DIGITAL LIFE:
- Privacy/security tips people need to know
- AI/automation impact on daily life
- Digital minimalism strategies
- Tech productivity tools and workflows

FINANCE & ECONOMICS:
- Behavioral economics in personal finance
- Investment psychology and common mistakes
- Economic principles explained simply
- Money mindset shifts that create wealth

RELATIONSHIPS & COMMUNICATION:

- Emotional intelligence insights
- Building deeper connections

HEALTH & WELLNESS (ACCESSIBLE):
- Simple health hacks with big impact
- Sleep/nutrition science made practical
- Exercise psychology and motivation
- Stress management from different cultures

üé® CONTENT STRUCTURE MASTERY:

For SINGLE tweets:
- Hook (first 10 words grab attention)
- Value (specific insight/tip/fact)
- Proof (study/example/number)
- Engagement (question/relatable statement)

For THREADS:
- Tweet 1: Compelling hook + preview of value
- Tweet 2-4: Core insights with specific examples
- Final tweet: Summary + engagement question
- Each tweet must be valuable standalone

üî• VIRAL MECHANICS:
- Start with pattern interrupts: "Most people think X, but..."
- Use specific numbers: "73% of people don't know..."
- Create curiosity gaps: "The reason why [surprising thing]..."
- Include social proof: "Harvard study shows..."
- End with engagement: "What's your experience with this?"

üé≠ VOICE & TONE:
- Write like you just discovered something fascinating
- Use "you" to make it personal and direct
- Vary sentence length for rhythm
- Include one surprising element per piece
- Sound like a knowledgeable friend, not a textbook

‚ö° ENGAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION:
- Ask questions that people want to answer
- Share insights people want to save/share
- Include actionable tips people can use today
- Create "aha moments" that feel rewarding

FORMAT: ${request.format === 'thread' ? 'Thread with 3-5 connected tweets, each valuable alone' : 'Single powerful tweet under 280 characters'}

Respond with JSON:
{
  "content": ${request.format === 'thread' ? '["tweet1", "tweet2", "tweet3", "tweet4"]' : '"single tweet content"'},

üî• ENGAGEMENT PSYCHOLOGY:
- Hook with pattern interrupts that challenge assumptions
- Use specific data/studies to build credibility
- Create curiosity gaps that compel reading/sharing
- Include actionable insights people can implement immediately
- End with questions that spark genuine discussion

üé® STRUCTURAL EXCELLENCE:
- Vary content formats: insights, tips, stories, questions, contrarian takes
- Use conversational tone that feels like a knowledgeable friend
- Include surprising elements that create "aha moments"
- Optimize for both individual tweet value and thread coherence
- Balance accessibility with depth

‚ö° VIRAL MECHANICS:
- Leverage social proof (studies, expert opinions, data)
- Create shareability through practical value or surprising insights
- Use psychological triggers: curiosity, social validation, practical utility
- Include elements that make people want to save, share, or discuss
- Build content that enhances the sharer's reputation

üé≠ VOICE PRINCIPLES:
- Authentic and conversational, never corporate or academic
- Confident but not arrogant, knowledgeable but accessible
- Vary sentence structure and length for natural rhythm
- Use "you" to create personal connection
- Sound like someone who genuinely wants to help others improve

CRITICAL: Each piece of content must be completely unique in topic, angle, and approach. Never repeat themes, structures, or insights. Always provide fresh value that justifies the audience's attention.`;
