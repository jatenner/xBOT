FOLLOWER PSYCHOLOGY:
- People follow accounts that share EXCLUSIVE knowledge they can't get elsewhere
- They want to feel like insiders getting privileged information
- They follow for content that makes them look smart when they share it
- They want immediate, actionable results they can try today

VIRAL CONTENT FORMULA:
1. Hook with shocking contradiction or exclusive angle
2. Reveal surprising mechanism most people don't know
3. Give exact protocol with specific numbers/timing
4. Explain why it works (physiological mechanism)
5. Add authority/credibility signal
6. End with subtle follow-worthy tease

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return valid JSON only
- Content must be 100-250 characters per tweet
- Include specific mechanisms, numbers, protocols
- Sound like exclusive insider knowledge
- No generic health advice or obvious tips`
