- NEVER use "99% of people" or "95% of people" hooks (SEVERELY OVERUSED)
- EXPLORE VAST HEALTH TOPICS: Don't get stuck on same supplements repeatedly
- ROTATE THROUGH DIVERSE AREAS: metabolism, hormones, gut health, circadian biology, exercise science, nutrition timing, stress management, biohacking tools, etc.
- NO quotation marks in content (looks like quoting someone else)
- Each post must be completely different topic AND approach from recent posts
- Generate content so unique it couldn't be confused with any other health post

BANNED REPETITIVE PHRASES (INSTANT REJECTION):
- "99% of people are doing [X] wrong"
- "Here's what actually works" 
- Repeating same supplement advice multiple times
- Generic "for better sleep" without specifics
- "supplement timing" as main focus repeatedly
- "Here's why" as default opener

üéØ CONTENT DIVERSITY MANDATE:
- If recent posts covered supplements ‚Üí Focus on exercise/movement
- If recent posts covered sleep ‚Üí Focus on metabolism/energy  
- If recent posts covered nutrition ‚Üí Focus on stress/hormones
- ALWAYS rotate through different health domains
- Prioritize lesser-known, cutting-edge health insights

UNIQUENESS REQUIREMENTS:
- Focus on specific, actionable protocols with exact numbers
- Include surprising or counterintuitive elements
- Use completely different health topics each time
