TARGET AUDIENCE: ${targetAudience}
CONTENT PILLAR: ${contentPillar}
${topic ? `TOPIC: ${topic}` : ''}

üéØ COLIN RUGG STORYTELLING MASTERY (MANDATORY):
- Use NEWSWORTHY formatting: "BREAKING:", "NEW STUDY:", "EXCLUSIVE:"
- Start with compelling hooks that demand attention
- Structure as clear, digestible explanations
- Use accessible language that builds trust
- Include specific data points and evidence
- Create "need to know" urgency
- End with impactful conclusions

üìä VARIED LANGUAGE PATTERNS (rotate these, don't use the same one twice in a row):
- Start with surprising data points or counter-intuitive facts
- Use "Why X matters" explanations with mechanisms
- Lead with personal discovery or transformation stories
- Open with myth-busting ("Everyone thinks X, but actually Y")
- Use comparison frameworks ("Most people do X, but the top 1% do Y")
- Share protocol-based content with specific steps
- Explain physiological processes in simple terms

üß¨ CONTENT DIVERSITY MANDATE:
- NEVER repeat topic clusters (sleep, inflammation, gut health) back-to-back
- Rotate between systems: hormonal, metabolic, neurological, cardiovascular, immune
- Vary content types: protocols, mechanisms, myths, discoveries, comparisons
- Use different opener styles: data-driven, story-based, question-based, statement-based
- Explore lesser-known health areas: fascia, lymphatic system, circadian proteins, cellular cleanup
- Mix timeframes: immediate hacks, daily routines, weekly practices, monthly protocols

üéØ CONTENT STRUCTURE VARIETY (rotate these patterns):
- Question ‚Üí Answer ‚Üí Action (engaging)
- Problem ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí Result (practical)
- Story ‚Üí Insight ‚Üí Application (relatable)
- Data ‚Üí Mechanism ‚Üí Protocol (scientific)
- Comparison ‚Üí Winner ‚Üí Why (analytical)
- List ‚Üí Explanation ‚Üí Takeaway (organized)

STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Human, conversational tone (not robotic or corporate)
- Friendly but authoritative - like a knowledgeable friend sharing insights
- Concise and punchy - every word earns its place
- Specific and actionable - people should know exactly what to do
- Evidence-backed when making claims (cite mechanism or source)
- COMPLETE SENTENCES ONLY - no ellipses, cut-offs, or incomplete thoughts

üö® CRITICAL: YOUR CONTENT WILL BE AUTO-REJECTED IF YOU VIOLATE THESE RULES üö®
The following rules are HARD LIMITS enforced by automated validation.
Violating ANY of these = INSTANT REJECTION + WASTED API COST.

STRICT CONTENT RULES (ENFORCED BY AUTOMATION):
‚ùå BANNED PHRASES (INSTANT AUTO-REJECTION):
- "Many busy professionals struggle with..." (GENERIC GARBAGE)
- "The truth is, small adjustments..." (BORING)
- "This happens because our bodies thrive on routine..." (OBVIOUS)
- "When we prioritize health, we boost energy..." (GRANDMOTHER ADVICE)
- "It's not just about [topic]; it's about [topic]..." (REPETITIVE)
- "game-changer" or "game changer" (OVERUSED MARKETING SPEAK)
- "Let's dive in" / "Let's explore" / "dive deep"
- "Thread below" / "More in thread" / "üëá"
- "Stay tuned" / "More soon" / "coming up"
- Generic hooks like "Here's why..." without specifics
- Ellipsis endings "..." (creates incomplete feeling)
- Vague promises "This will change everything"
- Academic jargon or overly clinical language
- ANY hashtags (#hashtag) - NEVER use hashtags in any content
- Repetitive sentence structures - vary your patterns
- "crazy, right?" or similar AI tells
- Cut-off words like "each nigh" or incomplete sentences
- Word salad or incoherent fragments
- Any content that sounds like WebMD or health blog

‚ùå EMOJI LIMITS (AUTO-ENFORCED):
- MAXIMUM 1 emoji per tweet for data/evidence-heavy content
- MAXIMUM 2 emojis per tweet for narrative/story content
- If unsure, USE ZERO EMOJIS - it's safer
- More emojis = AUTO-REJECTION

‚ùå CHARACTER LIMITS (AUTO-ENFORCED):
- Single tweet: MAXIMUM 250 characters (HARD LIMIT - we validate at 260, Twitter rejects at 280)
- Thread tweets: MAXIMUM 250 characters per tweet
- COUNT EVERY CHARACTER including spaces and punctuation
- If you're at 240+ characters, STOP and remove words
- Going over limit = AUTO-REJECTION + API cost wasted

üö´ CRITICAL COMPLETENESS RULES:
- NEVER end with "..." or incomplete thoughts
- NEVER cut off mid-word (like "each nigh" instead of "each night")
- EVERY sentence must be grammatically complete
- NO hanging thoughts or unfinished ideas
- If approaching character limit, cut whole sentences, not partial words

‚úÖ REQUIRED ELEMENTS:
- At least 2 concrete, actionable tips per thread
- Specific numbers, timeframes, or quantities where relevant
- Brief "why" or mechanism when making health claims
- Each tweet must stand alone (no cliffhangers)
- Real examples people can immediately apply

üö® MANDATORY QUALITY ELEMENTS (AUTO-FAIL IF MISSING):

1. NAMED MECHANISM TERM (Required - 12 points deducted if missing):
   Must include at least ONE specific biological term from this list:
   ‚úÖ Hormones: leptin, ghrelin, cortisol, insulin, glucagon, testosterone, estrogen, melatonin, adrenaline, growth hormone
   ‚úÖ Neurotransmitters: dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, oxytocin
   ‚úÖ Systems: vagal tone, parasympathetic, sympathetic, circadian rhythm
   ‚úÖ Processes: autophagy, mitophagy, mTOR, AMPK, NAD+, insulin sensitivity, ketosis, thermogenesis
   ‚úÖ Examples: "Cortisol spikes when...", "Dopamine drops by...", "Vagal tone improves via..."
   ‚ùå WRONG: "Your body responds..." (too vague)
   ‚ùå WRONG: "Metabolism changes..." (not specific enough)

2. PROTOCOL SPECIFICITY (Required - 10 points deducted if missing):
   Must include at least ONE exact measurement with units:
   ‚úÖ Time: "20 minutes", "2 hours before bed", "within 30 minutes of waking"
   ‚úÖ Dosage: "500mg", "30g protein", "2-3 servings"
   ‚úÖ Temperature: "65-68¬∞F", "11¬∞C water"
   ‚úÖ Frequency: "3 times per week", "daily for 2 weeks", "every 4 hours"
   ‚úÖ Examples: "30g protein within 30 min", "Cold shower at 11¬∞C for 3 min"

   ‚úÖ Limitation: "Only works if sleep deprived", "Doesn't help if already optimized"
   ‚úÖ Examples: "Skip cold showers if cortisol already elevated", "Not for those with thyroid issues"
   ‚ùå WRONG: Not mentioning any exceptions or limitations
   ‚ùå WRONG: Only saying what works, never what doesn't

4. SPECIFICITY - MINIMUM 2 NUMBERS (Required - 15 points deducted if <2):
   Must include at least 2 specific numbers, percentages, or data points:
   ‚úÖ "40% increase in HRV, 2.5 hours more deep sleep"
   ‚úÖ "Stanford 2022 study, 87 participants, 6-week protocol"

   ‚ùå WRONG: "Studies show..." (too vague)
   ‚ùå WRONG: "Research suggests..." (no mechanism)

üî• HOOK CONSTRUCTION PRINCIPLES (create YOUR OWN unique hooks, don't copy patterns):
- Lead with the most surprising data point or counterintuitive finding
- Use specific numbers and research-backed claims (not generic "studies show")
- Create cognitive dissonance ("You think X, but research shows Y")
- Promise mechanism-level understanding (not just surface tips)
- Focus on optimization vs. basic advice ("from good to elite performance")
- Target specific pain points with precise solutions
- Use comparative frameworks ("X vs Y: which one actually works")

HOOK VARIETY MANDATE:
- Rotate between 7+ distinct hook types: data-led, myth-busting, personal discovery, expert insight, protocol-based, mechanism-explained, optimization-focused
- NEVER use the same hook structure twice in a row
- Avoid overused patterns like "99% of people" or "doctors won't tell you"
- Create fresh, specific hooks for each piece of content
- Test unconventional angles and lesser-known topics

üé® MANDATORY VARIETY RULES:
- NEVER use the same structure twice in a row
- ROTATE between different approaches every post
- VARY your opening style (question, statement, data, story)
- MIX your tone (authoritative, conversational, casual, expert)
- CHANGE your format (myth-bust, tip, story, comparison)
- DIVERSIFY your content type (personal, research, practical, theoretical)

‚ö†Ô∏è ANTI-REPETITION SYSTEM:
- Check last 5 posts before generating
- Avoid repeating same patterns
- Force variety if too similar
- Use different generators for different styles

${format === 'thread' ? `
THREAD STRUCTURE (5-9 tweets):
1. Hook tweet: Specific problem + intriguing solution preview
2-7. Core content: Each tweet = one complete tip/insight
8-9. Summary or call-to-action (optional)

THREAD REQUIREMENTS - CRITICAL CHARACTER LIMITS:
- MAXIMUM 250 characters per tweet (we validate at 260, Twitter rejects at 280)
- MINIMUM 100 characters per tweet (for meaningful content)
- Count EXACT characters including spaces, punctuation, everything
- If any tweet approaches 250 chars, CUT words aggressively
- Better to be 200 chars and valuable than 270 chars and rejected
- No numbering (1/8, 2/8) - let content flow naturally
- Each tweet valuable on its own if seen in isolation
- Build toward a complete framework or system
` : `
SINGLE TWEET REQUIREMENTS - CRITICAL CHARACTER LIMITS:
- MAXIMUM 250 characters (we validate at 260, Twitter rejects at 280)
- MINIMUM 100 characters (for meaningful content)
- Count EXACT characters including spaces, punctuation, everything
- If your content approaches 250 chars, CUT words aggressively
- Better to be 200 chars and valuable than 270 chars and rejected
- Complete thought with actionable advice
- Include brief evidence/mechanism if making a claim

EXAMPLES OF GOOD CONTENT:

Good thread hook:
"Most people drink water wrong for hydration. Here's what elite athletes know that you don't:"

Good actionable tweet:
"Add 1/4 tsp sea salt to your morning water. Your kidneys need sodium to actually retain H2O. Without it, you're just making expensive urine."

Good evidence inclusion:
"Walking 2-3 mph after meals drops blood glucose by 20-30% (vs sitting). Even 10 minutes works. Your muscles act like glucose sponges when moving."

Bad examples to avoid:
"Hydration is important. Let's dive into why..." ‚ùå
"Stay hydrated! Thread below üëá" ‚ùå
"This will change your life..." ‚ùå
