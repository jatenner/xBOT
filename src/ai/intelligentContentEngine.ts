Topic: "${topic}"

Your job: Find the angle that will make people stop scrolling and actually care.

Consider:
1. What misconception do most people have about this?
2. What surprising fact would make someone say "wait, really?"
3. What practical problem does this solve?
4. What's a contrarian take that's actually true?
5. What's the "hidden" insight most people miss?

Also decide: Should this be a single tweet (quick insight) or thread (needs explanation + action steps)?

Rules:
- Pick ONE angle (the strongest one)
- Be specific, not vague
- Think about what would make YOU stop and read
- Consider what's shareable/quotable

Return ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "angle": "the specific angle to take",

Plan a ${analysis.contentType} structure with these components:

${analysis.contentType === 'thread' ? `
For a THREAD (needs to explain + give solutions):
- Hook: One powerful opening line that makes people stop
- Context: 2-3 sentences why this matters
- Mechanism: How it works (simple explanation)
- Problem: What people are doing wrong
- Solution: How to fix it (transition line)
- Action Steps: 3-5 specific things to do
- Timeline: When to expect results
- Closer: Thought-provoking final line
` : `
For a SINGLE TWEET (quick insight):
- Hook: Strong opening
- Core point: The main insight
- Why it matters: Brief context
- Closer: Memorable line
`}

Keep each component concise. Use conversational language.
Think: explaining to a friend over text.

Return ONLY valid JSON with these fields:
${analysis.contentType === 'thread' 
  ? '{"hook": "", "context": "", "mechanism": "", "problem": "", "solution": "", "actionSteps": ["", ""], "timeline": "", "closer": ""}'

STRUCTURE TO FOLLOW:
${JSON.stringify(structure, null, 2)}

YOUR VOICE:
- Direct and helpful
- Conversational (like texting a friend)
- Occasionally contrarian
- Always practical
- No academic BS

STYLE RULES:
‚úÖ DO:
- Use "you" and "your" (make it personal)
- Short sentences mixed with longer ones
- Contractions (don't, isn't, won't, here's, it's)
- Metaphors that simplify complex ideas
- Specific numbers (not "many" but "60%" or "3 weeks")
- Action steps people can actually do
- Timelines for when to expect results

‚ùå DON'T:
- Academic citations (n=200, et al., p<0.05, Smith 2021)
- Phrases like "Studies show" or "Research indicates"
- Formal language (individuals, optimal, facilitate, utilize)
- Numbered lists like "1." "2." "3." or "Step 1"
- Labels like "Tweet 1:" or "Hook:" or "Part 1:"
- Generic advice (listen to your body, consistency is key)
- Explain without giving solutions

CONTEXT:
Recent posts to differentiate from: ${recentContext}
Trending topics: ${trendingContext}

${analysis.contentType === 'thread' ? `
THREAD FORMAT:
Write 7-10 parts that flow naturally. Each part is 1-3 sentences.
Separate parts with a blank line.
NO numbering, NO labels, just natural flow.

Example flow:
[Hook line]

[Context sentences]

[Mechanism explanation]

[Problem identification]

[Solution intro]

[Specific action]
[Specific action]
[Specific action]

[Timeline]

[Closing insight]
` : `
SINGLE TWEET FORMAT:
Write one cohesive tweet (240-280 characters).
Make it punchy and memorable.
`}

IMPORTANT:
- Make it USEFUL - people should know exactly what to do
- Sound like a real person, not a content robot
- Each part should flow naturally into the next
- If it's a thread, make sure it's COMPLETE (explains + gives solutions)

Write the content now (NO labels or structure markers, just the content):`;

Your job: Make it sound MORE human and natural.

Changes to make:
- Remove any remaining formal/academic language
- Add more contractions where natural
- Vary sentence length (mix very short with longer)
- Make transitions smoother between parts
- Add personality (occasional "honestly", "here's the thing", "turns out")
- Remove anything that sounds "written" vs "spoken"
- Make it flow like someone passionately explaining something

The goal: Sounds like texting insights to a friend, not writing an essay.
