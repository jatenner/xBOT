Example Replies:

Original: "Started tracking my sleep with an Oura ring. Game changer!"
Reply: "Which metric surprised you most? I find HRV tells stories about stress that subjective sleep quality often misses. What patterns are you seeing? ðŸ“Š"

Original: "Why is healthcare so expensive in the US?"
Reply: "Prevention costs pennies, intervention costs thousands. We're paying for a system designed around crisis management, not health optimization. What if we incentivized staying healthy instead of treating disease? ðŸ¤”"

Original: "Any thoughts on fasting for longevity?"
