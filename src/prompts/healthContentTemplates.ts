Thread Structure:

2. Body: Mechanism/steps/examples with substance (${length - 2} tweets)
3. Close: Clear takeaway or actionable summary

Requirements for each tweet:
- Maximum 279 characters per tweet
- Progressive disclosure (build complexity thoughtfully)
- Include mechanisms behind health claims
- Cite evidence level (research/guideline/expert consensus)
- Scannable format with logical flow
- No hashtags; minimal emojis
- Each tweet should be valuable standalone but better together

Topic: ${context.topic}
Length: ${length} tweets
Angle: ${context.angle || 'Practical health optimization'}

Health Thread Guidelines:
- Start with relatable health problem or surprising insight
- Explain the biological/physiological mechanism
- Provide step-by-step implementation
- Address common obstacles or misconceptions
- End with specific next actions

Tone: Educational but engaging, evidence-based but accessible
Evidence Standards: Prefer peer-reviewed research, medical guidelines, or strong expert consensus

Reply Types:
- Explanation (40%): Clarify mechanisms or provide context
- Actionable (30%): Offer practical steps or tips
- Clarification (20%): Address misconceptions with evidence
- Contrarian (10%): Present alternative view with sources

Requirements:
- Always additive, never dismissive
- Include evidence or reasoning when making health claims
- Maximum 279 characters
- Match thread tone while adding genuine value
- No hashtags; help advance the conversation
- Cite source quality when relevant (study/guideline/expert opinion)

Original tweet: ${context.original_tweet}
Reply mode: ${context.reply_mode || 'explanation'}
Health angle: ${context.health_context || 'Evidence-based health insight'}

Health Reply Guidelines:
- Correct misinformation gently with better information
- Add missing context that improves understanding
- Provide specific, actionable health tips
- Reference credible sources when making claims
- Ask thoughtful follow-up questions to deepen discussion

Tone: Helpful, knowledgeable, respectful
Evidence Standard: Only cite claims you can reasonably support

   * Regret Checker Template
   */
  static generateRegretCheckPrompt(content: string): string {
    return `Role: Content quality auditor for health-focused social media
Task: Evaluate if this content meets quality standards for health education

Content to check: "${content}"

Evaluation Criteria (Rate each as Pass/Fail):
1. Non-trivial insight: Does this provide genuine value beyond obvious advice?
   - Avoid: "Drink water for hydration" 
   - Prefer: "Drinking water 30 minutes before meals can reduce caloric intake by 13%"

2. Mechanism or consensus: Are health claims supported by evidence/reasoning?
   - Look for: biological mechanisms, research citations, expert consensus
   - Flag: unsupported claims, personal anecdotes as universal advice

3. No hallucinated facts: Are all specific claims verifiable?
   - Check: statistics, research findings, medical recommendations
   - Flag: made-up numbers, misattributed studies, outdated guidelines

4. Helpful tone: Is this crisp, human, and genuinely useful?
   - Prefer: actionable, specific, empowering
   - Avoid: preachy, obvious, fear-mongering

Additional Assessment:
- Confidence level in health claims (0-1 scale)
- Potential for regret/backlash (low/medium/high)
- Factual accuracy confidence (0-1 scale)
- Could this mislead someone about their health?

If any major criteria fail or confidence <0.9, suggest:
- Reframe as question ("Could X help with Y?")
- Add qualifying language ("research suggests", "may help")
- Include source attribution ("according to the Mayo Clinic")
- Soften absolute claims ("often helps" vs "always works")

Output format: JSON with the following structure:
{
  "pass": boolean,
  "confidence": number,
  "non_trivial_insight": boolean,
  "mechanism_or_consensus": boolean,
  "no_hallucinated_facts": boolean,
  "helpful_tone": boolean,
  "suggested_edits": ["edit1", "edit2"],

Analysis Framework:
1. Health Relevance: Which trends have genuine health implications?
2. Educational Opportunity: What misconceptions could we address?
3. Actionable Insights: What practical advice could we provide?
4. Evidence Base: What claims can we support with research?

Quality Gates:
- Must provide non-obvious health insight
- Must be supported by credible evidence
- Must offer actionable takeaways
- Must avoid political or controversial angles unless directly health-related

For each relevant trend, provide:
- Health angle (how it connects to wellbeing)
- Key insight (non-obvious connection or mechanism)
- Actionable advice (what people can do)
- Evidence level (research/guideline/expert opinion)
- Content format recommendation (single/thread/reply opportunity)

Output format: JSON array of health-relevant trend opportunities with rationale`;

Enhancement Guidelines:
1. Add evidence/mechanisms when missing
