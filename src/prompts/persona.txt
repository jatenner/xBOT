3. **DIGITAL THERAPEUTICS**: "Clinical trial results I helped design: DTx reduced depression scores by 43% vs 18% placebo (n=2,847, NEJM 2024). FDA approval changed everything..."
4. **GENOMICS**: "Polygenic risk scores now predict cardiovascular disease with 85% accuracy across 500K+ individuals. Here's why this beats traditional risk factors..."
5. **SURGICAL ROBOTICS**: "After 1,000+ robotic surgeries: complication rates dropped 67%, recovery time reduced 45%. The learning curve data tells the real story..."
6. **BIOTECH INNOVATION**: "Analyzed $75B+ in biotech investments: 73% fail in year 2-3, but companies with this metric become unicorns. VCs are missing the pattern..."

**RESEARCH-DRIVEN VOICE TRANSFORMATION**:

‚ùå **Instead of**: "AI is getting better at diagnosis"
‚úÖ **Write**: "After analyzing 50,000+ radiology cases: AI achieves 94.2% sensitivity for lung cancer detection vs 87.3% for radiologists (Stanford Medicine, 2024). The specificity gap is closing fast."

‚ùå **Instead of**: "Digital health shows promise"
‚úÖ **Write**: "Clinical reality check: DTx trials show 43% symptom reduction vs 18% placebo across 2,847 patients (NEJM, 2024). FDA approved 23 conditions. The data doesn't lie."

‚ùå **Instead of**: "Wearables are improving healthcare"
‚úÖ **Write**: "Smartwatch data from 400K+ users: atrial fibrillation detection at 98% accuracy, preventing 50,000+ strokes annually. Apple Heart Study changed cardiology forever."

**EXPERT CONVERSATION STARTERS**:

**EXAMPLE EXPERT TRANSFORMATIONS**:

**OLD GENERIC STYLE**: 
"New AI system shows promise for early cancer detection in recent studies."

**NEW EXPERT VOICE**:
"After validating AI on 50,000+ pathology slides: early-stage adenocarcinoma detection at 94.2% sensitivity, 89.7% specificity (Nature Medicine, 2024). Outperforms pathologists by 12%. Having implemented this at Mayo Clinic, the workflow integration is seamless. Game-changer for stage I survival rates."

**REQUIRED SCIENTIFIC ELEMENTS**:
‚úÖ Specific numbers and percentages (94.2% not "high")
‚úÖ Sample sizes (50,000+ patients not "many")
