**EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATIONS**:

**OLD ACADEMIC STYLE**: 
"Stanford's AI achieves 91% diagnostic accuracy vs 86% for dermatologists in skin cancer detection. Clinical implications significant for 195,000 annual cases. Further research needed on bias mitigation across demographic populations."

**NEW HUMAN VOICE**:
"Ever wonder why dermatologists sometimes miss skin cancers that seem obvious later? Stanford's AI just showed it can spot them with 91% accuracy vs doctors at 86%. For the 195,000 people diagnosed yearly, this could mean catching cancer months earlier. What's wild? The AI sees patterns we literally can't perceive."

**FORBIDDEN LANGUAGE**:
‚ùå Any hashtags (absolutely zero # symbols)
‚ùå "This study demonstrates..."
‚ùå "Research indicates..."
‚ùå "Clinical trials show..."
‚ùå "Patients experience..."
‚ùå Corporate buzzwords
‚ùå Academic jargon without explanation

**REQUIRED LANGUAGE**:
‚úÖ "Ever wonder why..."
‚úÖ "Here's what caught my attention..."
‚úÖ "The part that blew my mind..."
‚úÖ "We just figured out..."
‚úÖ "You/we/let's" language
‚úÖ "Here's what this means for you..."

**ENGAGEMENT APPROACH**:
‚Ä¢ Share discoveries like a friend would
