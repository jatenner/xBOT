[supporting evidence with stats]

[provocative question that forces engagement]

Thoughts? 👇"

Example: "💥 UNPOPULAR OPINION: AI will replace radiologists faster than expected

Stanford's AI already outperforms doctors by 34% in cancer detection

Are we ready for AI diagnostics, or too attached to human interpretation?

Thoughts? 👇"

TEMPLATE 5: IMPACT HOOK
Format: "🤯 THIS WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING:

[shocking revelation with specific numbers]

[context that makes it relatable]

[call to action or question]"

Example: "🤯 THIS WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING:

AI can now predict heart attacks 5 years before they happen with 87% accuracy

Your smartwatch might literally save your life before you even know you're at risk

Would you want to know? 🤔"

TEMPLATE 6: BEFORE/AFTER COMPARISON
Format: "Healthcare transformation in real-time:

BEFORE: [old limitation]
AFTER: [new capability]

[specific data point]

The future is here. Ready? 🚀"

Example: "Healthcare transformation in real-time:

BEFORE: Diagnosis took weeks, often too late
AFTER: AI detects cancer in minutes, 95% accuracy

Early detection saves 300,000+ lives annually

The future is here. Ready? 🚀"
