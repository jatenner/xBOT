SCORE EACH DIMENSION (0-100):

1. Intelligence Score:
   - Does this offer unique perspective or just state facts?
   - Does this challenge assumptions or make you think differently?
   - Is there depth and insight, not just surface-level info?

2. Engagement Potential:
   - Would this stop your scroll?
   - Does the hook create curiosity?
   - Is it interesting enough to read fully?

3. Viral Potential:
   - Would you share this with a friend?
   - Does it have shareability (surprising, useful, provocative)?
   - Could this spread organically?

4. Actionability:
   - Can someone actually USE this information?
   - Are there concrete next steps or takeaways?
   - Is it practical, not just theoretical?

5. Memorability:
   - Would you remember this tomorrow?
   - Does it have a sticky insight or memorable framing?
   - Is there a quotable moment?

ALSO IDENTIFY:
- Strengths: What makes this content good?
- Weaknesses: What's missing or could be better?
- Improvement suggestions: Specific ways to enhance
