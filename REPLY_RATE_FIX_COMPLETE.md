# âœ… Reply Rate Fix - Complete

## Problem
Reply rate was **1.5-2 replies/hour** instead of the target **4 replies/hour**.

## Root Cause
Two issues found:

1. **Job Scheduling:** Reply job was hardcoded to run every **15 minutes** in `jobManager.ts`
2. **Config Ignored:** The `JOBS_REPLY_INTERVAL_MIN` environment variable was not being used

This meant:
- Job runs: 4 times/hour (every 15 min)
- But only 1 reply generated per run (due to rate limiting)
- Result: ~1.5-2 replies/hour

## Solution Deployed

### 1. Updated Config Default (src/config/config.ts)
```typescript
JOBS_REPLY_INTERVAL_MIN: z.number().default(30), // Replies every 30min (2 runs Ã— 2 batch = 4 replies/hour)
```

### 2. Fixed Job Scheduler (src/jobs/jobManager.ts)
Changed from hardcoded interval:
```typescript
15 * MINUTE, // Every 15 minutes - hardcoded
```

To using config value:
```typescript
config.JOBS_REPLY_INTERVAL_MIN * MINUTE, // Use config value (default: 30 min = 2 runs/hour)
```

### 3. Railway Production Environment
```bash
JOBS_REPLY_INTERVAL_MIN=30      âœ… Set
REPLY_BATCH_SIZE=2              âœ… Correct
REPLY_MINUTES_BETWEEN=15        âœ… Correct
REPLY_MAX_PER_DAY=100           âœ… Correct
REPLY_STAGGER_BASE_MIN=5        âœ… Correct
REPLY_STAGGER_INCREMENT_MIN=10  âœ… Correct
```

## How It Works Now

### Every 30 Minutes:
```
Minute 0:  Reply job runs, generates 2 replies
Minute 5:  Reply 1 posts (5 min stagger)
Minute 15: Reply 2 posts (15 min stagger)
Minute 30: Reply job runs AGAIN, generates 2 MORE replies
Minute 35: Reply 3 posts (5 min stagger)
Minute 45: Reply 4 posts (15 min stagger)
```

**Result: 4 replies per hour, nicely distributed!**

## Deployment Status

âœ… Code committed (2 commits)
âœ… Pushed to GitHub (main branch)
âœ… Railway environment variables set
âœ… Railway deployment triggered
âœ… New deployment verified in logs:
```
ðŸ•’ JOB_MANAGER: Scheduling reply_posting - first run in 60s, then every 30min
```

## Expected Hourly Pattern (Next 24 Hours)

```
Hour 1: 4 replies (at minutes 5, 15, 35, 45)
Hour 2: 4 replies
Hour 3: 4 replies
...
Hour 24: 4 replies

Total: ~96 replies/day (well within 100/day cap)
```

## Monitoring

Check dashboard at: `https://xbot-production-844b.up.railway.app/dashboard/replies?token=xbot-admin-2025`

Expected metrics:
- **Current rate:** 1.5-2 replies/hour (old system)
- **New rate (after fix):** 4 replies/hour (target achieved!)

Monitor for next 2-3 hours to confirm 4 replies are posting per hour.

## Files Changed

1. `src/config/config.ts` - Updated default from 15 to 30 minutes
2. `src/jobs/jobManager.ts` - Use config value instead of hardcoded 15 minutes
3. `.env` - Updated local config to match production

## Git Commits

```bash
fb31b864 - Fix reply rate: run job every 30min for 4 replies/hour
a56ed9e3 - Use JOBS_REPLY_INTERVAL_MIN config in reply job scheduler
```
