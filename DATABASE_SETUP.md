# üóÑÔ∏è DATABASE SETUP - Manual Migration Required

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Manual Step Required

**Railway does NOT automatically apply Supabase migrations.** You need to apply the database migration manually. This is a ONE-TIME setup.

---

## üöÄ QUICK SETUP (2 minutes)

### **Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (Easiest)**

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor:**
   ```
   https://app.supabase.com/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/sql
   ```

2. **Copy the migration SQL:**
   - Open: `supabase/migrations/20251018170436_content_violations_tracking.sql`
   - Copy ALL content (entire file)

3. **Paste and Run:**
   - Paste into SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" (or press Cmd+Enter)
   - Wait for "Success" message

4. **Verify:**
   ```sql
   -- Run this to verify table was created:
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM content_violations;
   -- Should return: 0
   ```

‚úÖ **Done!** The content quality system is now fully operational.

---

### **Option 2: Command Line (If you have psql)**

```bash
# 1. Get your database URL from Railway
railway variables | grep DATABASE_URL

# 2. Apply migration directly
psql YOUR_DATABASE_URL -f supabase/migrations/20251018170436_content_violations_tracking.sql

# 3. Verify
psql YOUR_DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM content_violations;"
```

---

## üîç What This Creates

The migration creates:

### 1. **`content_violations` table**
Tracks every content sanitization violation:
- Generator name
- Violation type (first_person, banned_phrase, low_specificity, incomplete)
- Severity (critical, high, medium, low)
- Full content + context
- Action taken (rejected, retried, posted_anyway)

### 2. **`generator_quality_metrics` view**
Pre-computed metrics per generator:
- Total violations
- Violations by type
- Rejection rate
- Average specificity score

### 3. **Indexes**
Optimized for common queries:
- By generator + time
- By severity
- By violation type

### 4. **Refresh function**
```sql
SELECT refresh_generator_quality_metrics();
-- Run daily to update metrics
```

---

## üìä After Setup - Verify It Works

### Check First Violation (After First Post)

```sql
-- View latest violations
SELECT 
  generator_name,
  violation_type,
  severity,
  detected_phrase,
  content_preview
FROM content_violations
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Expected: 0 rows initially
-- After first few posts: Should see any violations logged
```

### Monitor Generator Performance

```sql
-- Top violating generators (run after 24 hours)
SELECT 
  generator_name,
  total_violations,
  first_person_count,
  critical_violations
FROM generator_quality_metrics
ORDER BY total_violations DESC;

-- Expected: Most generators should have 0-2 violations
-- If any generator has >10: Needs prompt improvement
```

---

## ‚ùå If You Skip This Step

**The system will still work**, but:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Violation tracking will fail (logged as errors)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot monitor generator performance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot identify which generators need improvement
- ‚úÖ Content sanitization still works (blocks bad content)
- ‚úÖ First-person language still blocked

**Recommendation:** Apply the migration to get full monitoring capabilities.

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Error: "relation already exists"
**Solution:** Table already created - you're good! ‚úÖ

### Error: "permission denied"
**Solution:** Use service role key or check RLS policies

### Error: "column does not exist"
**Solution:** You might have an old schema. Drop the table first:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS content_violations CASCADE;
-- Then rerun the migration
```

### Can't access Supabase Dashboard
**Solution:** Get URL from Railway:
```bash
railway variables | grep SUPABASE
```

---

## ‚úÖ Confirmation Checklist

After applying migration:

- [ ] Table `content_violations` exists
- [ ] View `generator_quality_metrics` exists
- [ ] Can query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM content_violations;`
- [ ] Function exists: `SELECT refresh_generator_quality_metrics();`
- [ ] No errors in application logs about violations table

---

## üìû Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Apply this migration (2 minutes)
2. ‚úÖ Restart Railway service (if needed)
3. ‚úÖ Monitor first post for violations
4. ‚úÖ Review violation logs after 24 hours

---

**File Location:** `supabase/migrations/20251018170436_content_violations_tracking.sql`

**Once completed, the entire content quality system will be fully operational with monitoring!**
