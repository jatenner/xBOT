     - `controversy_evidence_stance` (87% success)
     - `hook_value_cta` (83% success) 
     - `fact_question_insight` (80% success)
     - And 7 more optimized formats

3. **Content Generation**: "Create engaging content using best format"
   - Uses selected format as template
   - Applies health/performance focus
   - Ensures viral potential

4. **Performance Tracking**: "Learn from every interaction"
   - Monitors likes, retweets, replies, impressions
