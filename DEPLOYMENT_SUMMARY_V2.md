## 🎯 PR-A: Schema Migrations + DAO Fixes

### Changes Summary

#### 1. Schema Migrations (`20250930_production_ready_schema.sql`)
**Idempotent**: ✅ Safe to re-run  
**Rollback**: ✅ Included in migration comments

**Tables Enhanced**:
- `posted_decisions`: Added `profile_visits`, `link_clicks`, `bookmarks`
- `outcomes`: Added `follows`, `profile_visits`, `link_clicks`, `reward_composite`, `collected_pass`, `updated_at`
- `content_metadata`: Added `experiment_id`, `hook_pattern`, `novelty`, `readability_score`, `sentiment`, `tweet_id`

**Indexes Created**:
```sql
idx_outcomes_real         -- Fast lookup for real outcomes (learning)
idx_outcomes_pass         -- Fast lookup by collection pass
idx_cm_sched              -- Queue processing optimization
idx_cm_experiment         -- Experiment analysis
idx_cm_novelty            -- Novelty-based filtering
idx_posted_tweet          -- Tweet ID lookup for outcomes
```

**Data Backfill**:
```sql
-- Backfilled scheduled_at for existing pending items
UPDATE content_metadata 
SET scheduled_at = created_at + INTERVAL '15 minutes'
WHERE scheduled_at IS NULL AND status IN ('pending', 'queued');
```

#### 2. DAO Fixes (Bug Elimination)
**Issue**: References to non-existent `unified_ai_intelligence` table causing runtime errors

**Fixed Files**:
- ✅ `src/jobs/realOutcomesJob.ts` → Now queries `posted_decisions`
- ✅ `src/jobs/outcomeWriter.ts` → Now queries `posted_decisions`
- ✅ `src/lib/unifiedDataManager.ts` → Now uses `content_metadata` schema

**Impact**: Eliminated all `column unified_ai_intelligence.status does not exist` errors

#### 3. New Components

**Analytics Collector V2** (`src/jobs/analyticsCollectorJobV2.ts`)
- Two-pass metrics collection:
  - **Pass 1**: T+1h after posting (early engagement signals)
  - **Pass 2**: T+24h after posting (final metrics + follower attribution)
- Growth-focused metrics:
  - `follows`: New followers attributed to post
  - `profile_visits`: Profile click-throughs
  - `link_clicks`: External link engagement
- Composite reward calculation:
  ```
  reward = 0.5*fpki + 0.3*retweet_rate + 0.15*reply_rate + 0.05*novelty - 0.1*dup_penalty
  ```
- Exposure weighting to prevent high-reach dominance

**Twitter Scraper** (`src/posting/twitterScraper.ts`)
- Playwright-based metrics scraping interface
- Handles authenticated browser context
- Graceful error handling for missing metrics
- Follower attribution logic placeholder

**Browser Manager** (`src/browser/browserManager.ts`)
- Persistent browser context management
- Session loading from stored state
- Cleanup utilities

**OpenAI Retry Logic** (`src/services/openaiRetry.ts`)
- Exponential backoff with jitter for 429 errors
- Max retries: 2
- Delays: 500ms → 1s → 2s (with ±30% jitter)
- Logs: `[OPENAI_BACKOFF]` for monitoring
- Distinguishes 429 (retry) from quota exhaustion (no retry)

#### 4. Observability APIs

**Learning Status API** (`src/api/learningStatus.ts`)
- Endpoint: `GET /api/learning/status`
- Returns:
  - Predictor version
  - Exploration rate (decays 0.20 → 0.05)
  - Bandit arms with success/failure ratios, mean reward, CI width
  - Total outcomes (real vs simulated)
  - Budget status

**Growth Metrics API** (`src/api/growthMetrics.ts`)
- Endpoint: `GET /api/growth`
- Returns:
  - Followers gained (today, 7 days)
  - Average FPKI (follows per 1K impressions)
  - Top posts by follower impact
  - Engagement summary (ER, reward, impressions)
  - Novelty average
  - Reply uplift percentage

#### 5. Documentation

**Operations Runbook** (`README_OPERATIONS.md`)
- Complete operational guide
- Environment configuration (testing vs production)
- Go-live checklist with step-by-step instructions
- Verification procedures for each component
- Safe rollback procedures
- Troubleshooting guide
- 7-day experiment plan

**Tracking Issue** (`TRACKING_ISSUE.md`)
- Full task breakdown with checkboxes
- Acceptance criteria
- PR structure and grouping
- Progress tracking

## 🔧 Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Railway account with xBOT staging service
- [ ] Supabase staging database access
- [ ] GitHub repo access with PR permissions
- [ ] OpenAI API key with available quota

### Step 1: Create GitHub PR

```bash
# Option A: GitHub CLI
gh pr create \
  --base main \
  --head feat/schema-migrations-dao-fixes \
  --title "feat: Production-ready schema migrations + DAO fixes + analytics collector" \
  --body-file PR_DESCRIPTION.md

# Option B: GitHub Web
# Navigate to: https://github.com/jatenner/xBOT/pull/new/feat/schema-migrations-dao-fixes
```

### Step 2: Apply Migrations to Staging

```bash
# Connect to Supabase staging
export SUPABASE_DB_URL="<your-staging-db-url>"

# Run migration
cd supabase/migrations
psql $SUPABASE_DB_URL -f 20250930_production_ready_schema.sql

# Verify tables
psql $SUPABASE_DB_URL -c "\d outcomes"
psql $SUPABASE_DB_URL -c "\d content_metadata"
psql $SUPABASE_DB_URL -c "\d posted_decisions"
```

**Expected Output**:
```sql
-- outcomes should have:
follows          | integer                  |           | default 0
profile_visits   | integer                  |
link_clicks      | integer                  |
reward_composite | numeric(8,6)             |
collected_pass   | smallint                 | default 0 | CHECK (collected_pass IN (0,1,2))

-- content_metadata should have:
experiment_id    | text                     |
hook_pattern     | text                     |
novelty          | real                     | CHECK (novelty >= 0 AND novelty <= 1)
readability_score| real                     |
sentiment        | real                     | CHECK (sentiment >= -1 AND sentiment <= 1)
```

### Step 3: Deploy Code to Staging

**Option A: Railway Auto-Deploy (Recommended)**
```bash
# Merge PR to staging branch (if you have one)
git checkout staging
git merge feat/schema-migrations-dao-fixes
git push origin staging

# Railway will auto-deploy
```

**Option B: Manual Railway Deploy**
```bash
railway link  # Select xBOT staging service
railway up
```

**Option C: Merge to Main**
```bash
# After PR review & approval
git checkout main
git merge feat/schema-migrations-dao-fixes
git push origin main
# Railway production will auto-deploy
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

#### Check Railway Logs
```bash
railway logs --tail | grep -E "(ANALYTICS_COLLECTOR|OPENAI_BACKOFF|DAO)"
```

**Expected Success Patterns**:
```
[ANALYTICS_COLLECTOR] 📊 Starting real analytics collection (V2)...
[ANALYTICS_COLLECTOR] ℹ️ No posts ready for Pass 1 (T+1h)  # Expected if no recent posts
[OPENAI_BACKOFF] ⏱️  Retry 1/2 for content_generation after 534ms  # If 429s occur
✅ Real LLM content queued decision_id=...  # When OpenAI quota available
```

**Error Patterns to Watch**:
```
❌ column unified_ai_intelligence.status does not exist  # Should NOT appear
❌ Failed to connect to database  # Indicates migration issues
```

#### Check API Endpoints
```bash
# Learning status
curl https://xbot-staging.railway.app/api/learning/status | jq

# Growth metrics
curl https://xbot-staging.railway.app/api/growth | jq

# General metrics
curl https://xbot-staging.railway.app/api/metrics | jq
```

**Expected Responses**:
```json
// /api/learning/status
{
  "predictorVersion": "v0",
  "exploreRate": 0.200,
  "arms": [],
  "totalOutcomes": 0,
  "realOutcomes": 0,
  "budgetStatus": {
    "dailyLimit": 10,
    "used": 0,
    "remaining": 10
  }
}

// /api/growth
{
  "followers_today": 0,
  "followers_7d": 0,
  "fpki_avg_7d": 0,
  "top_posts_by_follows": [],
  "engagement_summary": {
    "total_posts_7d": 0,
    "avg_er_7d": 0
  }
}
```

#### Check Database State
```sql
-- Verify schema changes applied
SELECT decision_type, generation_source, status, COUNT(*) 
FROM content_metadata 
GROUP BY 1,2,3;

-- Verify no data loss
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_decisions FROM content_metadata;
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_posted FROM posted_decisions;
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_outcomes FROM outcomes;

-- Verify indexes
SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename IN ('content_metadata', 'outcomes', 'posted_decisions')
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;
```

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Manual Smoke Tests

#### 1. DAO Fix Verification
```bash
# This should NOT throw "unified_ai_intelligence.status does not exist" error
railway run npm run job:post-queue

# Expected: Either posts or logs "No decisions ready for posting"
```

#### 2. Analytics Collector Test
```bash
# Manually trigger (if admin endpoint exists)
curl -X POST https://xbot-staging.railway.app/api/admin/trigger-analytics \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Expected: Logs showing "No posts ready for Pass 1/2" or actual collection
```

#### 3. OpenAI Backoff Test
```bash
# Run plan job when quota is low (will hit 429s)
railway run npm run job:plan

# Expected logs:
# [OPENAI_BACKOFF] ⚠️ 429 rate limit hit
# [OPENAI_BACKOFF] ⏱️  Retry 1/2 after 523ms
```

### Automated Tests (To Be Added in PR-C)
- Unit tests for composite reward calculation
- Unit tests for exploration scheduling
- Integration tests for analytics collector passes
- E2E tests for posting queue workflow

## 🎛️ Environment Configuration

### Current Config (Staging - Posting OFF)
```bash
# Verify these are set correctly
railway variables list | grep -E "(POSTING|LLM|METRICS)"

# Should show:
POSTING_DISABLED=true          ✅ Correct for today
LIVE_POSTS=false               ✅ Correct for today
REAL_METRICS_ENABLED=false     ✅ Correct for today (no posts yet)
AI_QUOTA_CIRCUIT_OPEN=false    ✅ Allow LLM (if quota available)
```

### Tomorrow's Config (Production - Posting ON)
```bash
# After OpenAI quota resets + validation passes
railway variables set POSTING_DISABLED=false
railway variables set LIVE_POSTS=true
railway variables set REAL_METRICS_ENABLED=true

# Then restart
railway restart
```
