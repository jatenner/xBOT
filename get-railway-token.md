# üîë GET YOUR RAILWAY API TOKEN

## The token you provided appears to be a Project ID, not an API token.

### What You Gave Me:
- `6bdddc75-abfd-43a0-be32-ee7559dd56fe` ‚Üê This is a **Project Token** (wrong format)
- `c987ff2e-2bc7-4c65-9187-11c1a82d4ac1` ‚Üê This is your **Project ID** ‚úÖ

### What We Need:
A Railway **API Token** that looks like:
```
rw_Fe26.2**1ab0e3d7a6bce9a2a2d8cdb996b1480271b85c3f5f08483622f87779b55882dc*MbkvLONNUlMT9EieIDWdVA*aoAzKd86vr8qeudvDv...
```

## üéØ HOW TO GET THE CORRECT API TOKEN:

### Step 1: Go to Railway Tokens Page
Open this URL in your browser:
```
https://railway.app/account/tokens
```

### Step 2: Create a New Token
1. Click **"Create Token"** button
2. Give it a name: `xBOT-CLI-Access`
3. Click **"Create"**

### Step 3: Copy the Token
- The token will start with `rw_Fe26.2**`
- It will be VERY long (200+ characters)
- Copy the ENTIRE token

### Step 4: Give Me the Token
Paste it here and I'll configure your Railway CLI immediately.

## üöÄ ALTERNATIVE: Let's Use Railway Web Dashboard

Since the CLI is being difficult, I can show you how to:

1. **Set all 23 variables** via Railway web dashboard
2. **Deploy the changes** 
3. **Monitor via `npm run logs`** (our bulletproof monitor)

This will get your system operational in 2 minutes while we fix the CLI separately.

**Which would you prefer?**
- A) Get the API token and fix CLI now
- B) Use web dashboard to deploy variables immediately
